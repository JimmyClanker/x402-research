# Experiment Log

## Experiment 1 — Social scoring confidence weighting
- **Hypothesis:** social score was too sensitive to small mention counts and thin sentiment samples.
- **Change:** replaced linear mention growth with log scaling; sentiment spread now gets confidence weighting from total signals; reasoning includes confidence.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Benchmark:**
  - baseline: ETH 6.0 / SOL 5.3 / AAVE 5.7
  - after change: ETH 6.0 / SOL 5.3 / AAVE 4.0
- **Result:** kept. More conservative on sparse social data; ETH/SOL remained in range.

## Experiment 2 — Completeness from metadata collectors
- **Hypothesis:** completeness should follow `metadata.collectors.ok`, not object presence only.
- **Change:** temporarily switched completeness to metadata-driven logic.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Benchmark:** ETH 4.3 / SOL 3.5 / AAVE 4.0
- **Result:** discarded and reverted. Penalized too aggressively for normal partial-data cases.

## Experiment 3 — Cache corruption resilience
- **Hypothesis:** malformed cached JSON should not take down alpha requests.
- **Change:** wrapped cache JSON parsing in `try/catch`; corrupted rows are deleted and treated as cache misses.
- **Files:** `routes/alpha.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better graceful degradation with zero API changes.

## Experiment 4 — LLM output normalization hardening
- **Hypothesis:** model output can drift from schema (invalid verdict casing/spacing, duplicated bullets).
- **Change:** normalized verdicts to allowed enum values and deduplicated/trimmed array fields.
- **Files:** `synthesis/llm.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Safer downstream formatting without changing the public API.

## Experiment 5 — Social narrative cleanup + recency ordering
- **Hypothesis:** narrative extraction included noisy project tokens, and recent news should prefer newest entries first.
- **Change:** replaced the useless literal `projectName` stopword with real project token filtering; added generic token/coin stopwords; sorted `recent_news` by descending date before truncating.
- **Files:** `collectors/social.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better signal quality and more sensible news ordering.

## Experiment 6 — Report completeness visibility
- **Hypothesis:** users should see generation time and data completeness immediately, not buried inside the overall score reasoning.
- **Change:** surfaced `generated_at` and overall completeness in the text and HTML report headers.
- **Files:** `synthesis/templates.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better readability with no JSON/API contract changes.

## Experiment 7 — Market score adds FDV overhang + ATH distance
- **Hypothesis:** raw momentum + volume was too generous for tokens with large unlock overhang or still deeply below ATH.
- **Change:** market scoring now factors `FDV/MC` dilution risk and distance from ATH, while preserving the existing liquidity/momentum blend.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Benchmark:** ETH 6.0 / SOL 5.2 / AAVE 4.9 (completeness 60/60/60)
- **Result:** kept. Better market-quality discrimination without breaking score ranges.

## Experiment 8 — Development score adds repo freshness + issue pressure
- **Hypothesis:** stars and commits alone miss stale repos and overloaded issue queues.
- **Change:** development scoring now considers forks, days since last commit, and a light `open_issues / commits_90d` pressure penalty.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Benchmark:** ETH 5.1 / SOL 5.0 / AAVE 4.9 on a later live run; results were network-variable because social/tokenomics were partially unavailable, but scoring remained stable and non-breaking.
- **Result:** kept. Adds a useful maintenance-quality signal with conservative penalties.

## Experiment 9 — Social collector query expansion + article-level sentiment
- **Hypothesis:** two Exa queries under-covered catalysts/adoption narratives, and keyword totals overcounted sentiment from single noisy articles.
- **Change:** expanded Exa query set to include catalysts and adoption coverage; switched sentiment aggregation from raw keyword counts to one vote per article; dedupe key now normalizes title fallback.
- **Files:** `collectors/social.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better data coverage and less sentiment inflation from repeated keywords.

## Experiment 10 — Onchain collector parallel discovery
- **Hypothesis:** chain detection and protocol-list discovery were serialized unnecessarily, increasing cold-start latency.
- **Change:** `collectOnchain()` now runs `tryChainTvl()` and the protocol list fetch in parallel before matching.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Small but clean latency win with no API changes.

## Experiment 11 — Data-quality summary surfaced in API/report + tokenomics slug coverage
- **Hypothesis:** users need faster visibility into partial-data conditions, and Messari lookups should try market name/symbol aliases, not only project/CoinGecko id.
- **Change:** added `data_quality` summary to alpha responses (completeness, failed collectors, latency bucket, duration), surfaced collector failures in text/HTML reports, and expanded Messari slug candidates with market `name` + `symbol`.
- **Files:** `routes/alpha.js`, `synthesis/templates.js`, `collectors/tokenomics.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better operator visibility on degraded runs and slightly wider tokenomics lookup coverage.

## Experiment 12 — Subtle chalkboard motion + hover polish
- **Hypothesis:** the page felt static; gentle reveal/hover effects can make the chalkboard UI feel more premium without breaking the minimalist style.
- **Change:** added layered chalkboard texture, panel sheen, fade-up entrance animation, and light hover elevation for buttons/panels/cards.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`
- **Validation:** inline script parsed via `vm.Script`; CSS/HTML syntax stayed valid.
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. More polished visual rhythm with very low UI risk.

## Experiment 13 — Responsive report layout and mobile market board
- **Hypothesis:** the desktop-first layout compressed too hard on phones, especially verdict/header blocks and the metric table.
- **Change:** refined breakpoints, stacked major grids earlier, made verdict/header blocks mobile-friendly, and converted the market board into a readable card-like stacked table on small screens.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`
- **Validation:** inline script parsed via `vm.Script`; responsive CSS remained syntactically valid.
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better mobile readability without changing the API or data model.

## Experiment 14 — Radar chart readability upgrade
- **Hypothesis:** the radar was visually on-theme but hard to read quickly; better scale cues and point styling would make scoring easier to interpret.
- **Change:** enlarged the chart slightly, added clearer grid/tick labels, endpoint dots, a center anchor, glow treatment, and stronger per-axis point markers.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`
- **Validation:** inline script parsed via `vm.Script`; generated SVG markup stayed valid.
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. The score radar should scan faster while preserving the chalkboard look.

## Experiment 15 — Animated score bars with clearer hierarchy
- **Hypothesis:** the score rows lacked hierarchy and felt utilitarian; adding microcopy and animated fill would improve scanability.
- **Change:** turned score rows into mini cards, added label/tone hierarchy, and animated bar fill using CSS custom properties while keeping the same score data.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`
- **Validation:** inline script parsed via `vm.Script`; CSS animation syntax remained valid.
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Scores now read faster and look more intentional.

## Experiment 16 — Verdict badge/cards polish + HTML report template upgrade
- **Hypothesis:** the main verdict and exported HTML report still felt more functional than premium; bringing the same design language to both surfaces would improve perceived quality.
- **Change:** redesigned the live verdict as a more deliberate badge, upgraded insight cards with accent rails/background depth, and rebuilt the exported HTML report with a stronger chalkboard layout, header, and section cards.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`, `synthesis/templates.js`
- **Validation:** `public/alpha.html` inline JS parsed via `vm.Script`; `synthesis/templates.js` imported successfully.
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. UI and exported report now feel visually consistent and more professional.

## Experiment 17 — Tokenomics base score normalization + circulating supply cap
- **Hypothesis:** `scoreTokenomicsRisk` started at base 6 while all other dimensions used base 4-5, creating an upward bias. Also, `pct_circulating` wasn't capped at 100, allowing CoinGecko rounding artifacts (>100%) to add phantom bonus points.
- **Change:** aligned base to 5 (consistent with other dimensions), capped `pct_circulating` at 100, adjusted the bonus curve to `pct/40` (max +2.5 at 100%), added a small +0.3 bonus for available `roi_data`.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. More accurate tokenomics scores; no free points from data artifacts.

## Experiment 18 — GitHub collector: language, description, license, watchers fields
- **Hypothesis:** GitHub API already returns `language`, `description`, `license`, and `watchers_count` in the repo response, but the collector was discarding them. These fields are useful for LLM context and future scoring dimensions.
- **Change:** added `language`, `description`, `license`, `watchers` to `createEmptyGithubResult` and populated them from `repoData` in the return statement.
- **Files:** `collectors/github.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Richer GitHub data at zero API cost; backward compatible (new optional fields).

## Experiment 19 — Error-resilient scoring: safeCollector guard
- **Hypothesis:** collectors that return `{ error: "...", totalVolume: ... }` would still have their numeric fields scored. If the collector has an error key, those numbers are unreliable — scoring should treat them as missing.
- **Change:** added `safeCollector()` helper that returns `{}` for any collector with `error` set. Applied to all 5 scoring functions in `calculateScores`.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass; manual test confirmed error-keyed collectors score as 0-data.
- **Result:** kept. Prevents phantom scores from partially-failed collectors.

## Experiment 20 — Tokenomics timeout: per-collector fresh clock
- **Hypothesis:** tokenomics must await market before starting Messari calls. Wrapped inside the global `withTimeout`, the tokenomics collector could have < 12s left if market took 8+s. This causes unnecessary timeouts.
- **Change:** removed tokenomics from the main `Promise.allSettled` timeout; instead applied a fresh 12s `withTimeout` that starts only after market resolves via `.then()` chaining.
- **Files:** `collectors/index.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Tokenomics gets a full 12s window regardless of market latency.

## Experiment 21 — UX: GitHub card in market board + change colorization
- **Hypothesis:** the new `language`, `description`, `license`, and `watchers` fields collected in Exp 18 weren't visible anywhere in the UI. Also, TVL change % values would benefit from green/red coloring to instantly signal direction.
- **Change:** added `renderGithubCard()` function and CSS (`github-card`, `lang-badge`, `license-badge`, `stat-badge`); injected card below metric table. Added `pos-change`/`neg-change` CSS classes and `changeClass()` helper for TVL % rows.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Market board now surfaces repo context inline; direction coloring improves data scanability.

- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 125 — scoreOnchainHealth: cap TVL changes to ±200%
- **Change:** TVL changes capped to [-200%, +200%] before scoring to prevent extreme new protocol launches (e.g. +10000%) or exploits (-99%) from dominating the score.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 126 — scoreDevelopment: missing github → 3.0 (unknown) not 4.0
- **Change:** When no GitHub data exists, return 3.0 instead of computing from base 4.0. Absence of dev evidence is mildly concerning, not neutral. Reasoning explicitly states "unverifiable".
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 127 — circuit-breakers: DeFi ghost protocol + extreme low token velocity
- **Change:** Two new warning breakers: (1) DeFi with TVL > $100M and zero social mentions → cap 6.5; (2) token velocity < 0.01% daily turnover → cap 6.0. Also added missing safeN helper.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

- **Files:** `services/red-flags.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 129 — scoreTokenomicsRisk: no-data guard → neutral 5.0

- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 130 — Commit R121-130
- **Commit:** 6894813 — 152 lines changed. Pushed to main.

### Round 131 — scoreDistribution: no-data guard → neutral 5.0
- **Change:** When no distribution-relevant data exists (pct_circulating, token_distribution, FDV/MCap pair), return 5.0 neutral instead of computing from partial data that defaults to 5.0 anyway with wrong reasoning.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 132 — circuit-breakers: persistent DeFi revenue collapse breaker
- **Change:** New warning breaker: if 7d revenue declined > 50% vs prior 7d AND monthly rate also declining, cap at 6.5. Renamed conflicting `fees7d` variable to `fees7dR132`.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 133 — red-flags: staking APY divergence detection
- **Change:** New red flag when advertised staking APY > 50% and realized APY diverges > 70% from advertised — signals unsustainable Ponzi-style yield mechanics.
- **Files:** `services/red-flags.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 134 — scoreRisk: empty data guard → neutral 5.0
- **Change:** When no risk-relevant fields are present (no price changes, no DEX data, no holder data, no genesis date), return 5.0 instead of optimistic 6.0. Unknown risk ≠ low risk.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 135 — scoreOnchainHealth: no-data guard → neutral 5.0
- **Change:** Many tokens are not DeFi protocols and have no TVL/fees. Instead of penalizing them with 4.0, return neutral 5.0 with "not applicable" reasoning.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

## Experiment 22 — SCORE_MOMENTUM: velocity metric
- **Hypothesis:** Signal importance correlates with how fast score changes (pts/hour), not just absolute delta.
- **Change:** Added `velocity` field (delta/hours) to SCORE_MOMENTUM signals; included in title and detail.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Velocity adds temporal context to momentum signals.

## Experiment 23 — SCORE_MOMENTUM: trend_consistency flag

- **Change:** Added trend_consistency boolean check (last 5 snapshots); flag shown in title/detail when true.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Provides confidence in direction (not just single delta).

## Experiment 24 — SCORE_MOMENTUM: normalized_delta
- **Hypothesis:** Delta of 1.5 is more significant at score 4 than at score 8; normalized_delta captures relative change.
- **Change:** Added normalized_delta (delta / current_score) to SCORE_MOMENTUM data_json.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Enables relative momentum comparison across different score levels.

## Experiment 25 — CATEGORY_LEADER_SHIFT: severity by change count
- **Hypothesis:** Complete top3 overhaul (3 new) is more significant than single token swap.
- **Change:** Severity = critical (3 new) | high (2 new) | medium (1 new); included change_count in data_json.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Severity now scales with magnitude of leadership change.

## Experiment 26 — CATEGORY_LEADER_SHIFT: score_gap
- **Hypothesis:** Score gap between new/old #1 indicates strength of regime change (large gap = dominant new leader).
- **Change:** Added score_gap (new_leader_score - old_leader_score) to detail and data_json.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Adds quality context to leadership shifts.

## Experiment 27 — BREAKER_ALERT: multiple breakers count + severity escalation
- **Hypothesis:** 3+ active breakers is critical risk; count provides context on token health.
- **Change:** Severity = critical (3+ breakers) | high (1-2); included breaker_count and all_breakers list in data_json.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Severity escalates with breaker count; full list logged for analysis.

## Experiment 28 — BREAKER_ALERT: duration check + severity escalation
- **Hypothesis:** Breaker active >48h (3+ snapshots) indicates persistent structural issue; should escalate to critical.
- **Change:** Check last 4 snapshots; if breaker present in 2+ previous = long_duration → severity = critical.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Persistent breakers flagged as critical; transient breakers remain high.

## Experiment 29 — DIVERGENCE: moderate divergence thresholds
- **Hypothesis:** Score 6.5/4.5 capture moderate divergence earlier; severity scale provides quality filter.
- **Change:** Lowered thresholds to 6.5 (positive) and 4.5 (negative); severity = high (extreme score ≥7.0/≤4.0), medium (moderate 6.5-7.0/4.0-4.5).
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Broader coverage with quality tier.

## Experiment 30 — DIVERGENCE: volume quality filter
- **Hypothesis:** Divergence on thin volume (<5% daily turnover) is less actionable; severity should downgrade.
- **Change:** Added volume_to_mcap calculation; low_volume flag downgrades high → medium severity.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Volume context improves signal quality filtering.

## Experiment 31 — Alpha Signals: CONVICTION_SCORE composite
- **Hypothesis:** 5+ strong signals indicate high conviction; composite bonus rewards multiple confluent strong signals.
- **Change:** getSignalStrengthScore adds +10 bonus per strong signal beyond 4th when strongCount ≥ 5.
- **Files:** services/alpha-signals.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Multi-signal conviction rewarded in strength score.

## Experiment 32 — Alpha Signals: SUPPLY_SHOCK

- **Change:** Added supply_shock signal checking circulating_supply % and FDV/MCap ratio.
- **Files:** services/alpha-signals.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Identifies supply compression conditions early.

## Experiment 33 — Alpha Signals: CROSS_CHAIN_TVL_GROWTH
- **Hypothesis:** Simultaneous TVL growth across multiple chains signals broad capital migration, not single-chain flukes.
- **Change:** Added cross_chain_tvl_growth signal for 2+ chains growing >15% TVL in 7d.
- **Files:** services/alpha-signals.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Detects multichain momentum early.

## Experiment 34 — Trade Setup: volatility-adjusted entry zone
- **Hypothesis:** Entry zone should adapt to recent volatility — wider for volatile tokens, tighter for stable.
- **Change:** Entry spread = 3% (low vol <5%), 5% (normal), 8% (high vol >20%) based on |price_change_7d|.
- **Files:** services/trade-setup.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Entry zones adapt to market conditions.

## Experiment 35 — Trade Setup: dynamic SL based on volatility
- **Hypothesis:** Fixed -15% SL is too tight for volatile tokens, too wide for stable. Adapt to 7d price change.
- **Change:** SL = -10% (low vol <10%), -15% (normal), -25% (high vol >30%); ATL override if closer.
- **Files:** services/trade-setup.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Stop losses adapt to token volatility profile.

## Experiment 36 — Trade Setup: Fibonacci TP targets
- **Hypothesis:** Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 61.8%, 100% ATH) provide better technical TP targets than fixed % gains.
- **Change:** TP1/TP2/TP3 use Fibonacci ATL→ATH levels when available, fallback to % gains otherwise.
- **Files:** services/trade-setup.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. TP targets align with technical support/resistance levels.

## Experiment 37 — Deduplicate safeNum/safeNumber into utils/math.js
- **Hypothesis:** `safeNum()` in collectors/market.js and `safeNumber()` in synthesis/scoring.js are identical utility functions; consolidating them reduces code duplication and establishes a shared numeric utilities module.
- **Change:** Created `utils/math.js` with a single `safeNumber(value, fallback=0)` function; updated imports in `collectors/market.js` and `synthesis/scoring.js`; renamed all `safeNum(...)` calls in market.js to `safeNumber(...)`.
- **Files:** utils/math.js (new), collectors/market.js, synthesis/scoring.js
- **Test:** `npm test` → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** kept. Shared utility module established; deduplication successful.


## Experiment 38 — JSDoc on all public exports in utils/
- **Hypothesis:** Security and math utility exports lack documentation; JSDoc improves code navigability and IDE autocomplete support.
- **Change:** Added JSDoc to `secureCompare()` in `utils/security.js` (format.js and math.js already had JSDoc).
- **Files:** utils/security.js
- **Test:** `npm test` → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** kept. All utils/ public functions now documented.


## Experiment 39 — JSDoc on createExaService in services/exa.js
- **Hypothesis:** Public API exports without JSDoc reduce code navigability and IDE autocomplete support.
- **Change:** Added JSDoc to `createExaService()` documenting params and return type.
- **Files:** services/exa.js
- **Test:** `npm test` → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** kept. Public service factory now documented.


## 2026-03-26 — AutoResearch Nightly Batch (Round 237 series, 30 improvements)

### Overview
30-round autonomous improvement batch targeting collector accuracy, scoring refinements, red flag detection, frontend UX, cross-dimensional analysis, and new data signals.

### Improvements Implemented

1. **Social: `competitor_content_ratio`** — New field tracking what fraction of articles frame the project in competitor context. High ratio (>60%) signals secondary coverage, not primary narrative. Used in scoring and red flags.

2. **Red flags: `falling_social_velocity`** — Fires when news_momentum is 'declining' AND sentiment_score < -0.2. Combination of declining coverage + bearish tone = fading narrative. Also added `secondary_coverage_only` info flag.

3. **Alpha signals: `community_score_leader`, `news_acceleration`, `governance_activity`** — Three new signals: top CoinGecko community score (>70), accelerating news coverage (>3 articles in 3 days), and active DAO governance (≥3 mentions).

4. **Circuit breakers: `zero_volume_high_mcap`, `no_github_large_cap`** — Zero 24h volume with high market cap triggers CRITICAL cap (4.0). No GitHub on >$50M cap token (non-meme) triggers WARNING cap (6.5).

5. **DexScreener: `sell_wall_risk`** — Composite signal detecting sell walls: high sell dominance + concentrated pool + accelerating volume = 'high' / 'elevated' / null. Used in scoring, LLM prompt, circuit breakers, and UI.

6. **Scoring social: `competitor_content_ratio` penalty** — When 50%+ of social coverage is competitor-framing, raw score penalized by up to -0.4.

7. **Market: `holder_engagement_score`** — New 0-100 composite combining volume/mcap velocity (50pts), community following (30pts), and trending bonus (20pts). Added to templates, UI metrics table, conviction scoring.

8. **LLM prompt: sell wall risk context block** — When DEX sell_wall_risk is 'elevated' or 'high', a dedicated ## SELL WALL RISK block appears in Opus prompt with actionable context for bear case.

9. **Report quality: sell wall + social credibility** — Adds issues for high sell wall risk and low social credibility + declining momentum, with score deduction.

10. **Templates: sell wall + holder engagement in text report** — Text report now shows ⚠️ Sell Wall Risk: HIGH/ELEVATED and Holder Engagement: X/100 in key metrics section.

11. **Reddit: upvote-weighted sentiment + `reddit_activity_score`** — Reddit sentiment now blends raw counts (60%) with log-scale upvote weights (40%). New `reddit_activity_score` (0-100) combines post count, upvote weight, recency, and subreddit diversity. Used in social scoring and confidence.

12. **Scoring distribution: `sell_wall_risk` penalty** — Applied directly in calculateScores() via distribution.score -= 0.6/0.3 for high/elevated sell wall risk.

13. **GitHub: `bus_factor_score`** — Gini-coefficient based (0-100) continuous score for contribution distribution. More nuanced than the categorical label. Used in dev dimension scoring.

14. **Dev scoring: `bus_factor_score` supplement** — Uses continuous Gini score to fine-tune dev dimension: <30 = penalty, >70 = bonus (only when label not already applied).

15. **Narrative momentum: 2026 AI narratives** — Added 5 new narrative clusters: `agent_commerce` (x402/A2A/MCP), `bitcoin_mainstream` (strategic reserve), `base_ecosystem`, `hyper_liquid` (Hyperliquid perps), `rwa_tokenization` (tokenized real estate/bonds).

16. **Social confidence: `reddit_activity_score` boost** — When reddit_activity_score ≥ 30, socialConf += 10, improving confidence on well-discussed tokens.

17. **LLM fact registry: 5 new facts** — Added holder_engagement_score, reddit_activity_score, competitor_content_ratio, sell_wall_risk, bus_factor_score to fact registry for LLM grounding.

18. **LLM data summary: sell wall risk in DEX section** — When sell_wall_risk is elevated/high, surfaces it prominently in the DEX section with ratio and volume momentum context.

19. **LLM data summary: engagement metrics block** — New ENGAGEMENT METRICS section shows holder_engagement_score and reddit_activity_score with human-readable labels when available.

20. **Alpha signals: `distributed_dev_plus_active_shipping`** — Fires when bus_factor_score ≥ 75 AND has_recent_release = true. Signals well-distributed team actively shipping = reduced key-person risk.

21. **Onchain: `revenue_per_active_user` + `active_addresses_7d`** — New product-market fit metric: daily revenue / daily active users. Also adds `active_addresses_7d` derived from daily active users × 7 × 0.6 uniqueness factor.

22. **Onchain scoring: `revenue_per_active_user` signal** — ≥$1/user/day = +0.4, ≥$0.10 = +0.2, ≥$0.01 = +0.05, <$0.01 = -0.1.

23. **Conviction: `holder_engagement_score` + sell wall bonuses** — High holder engagement (+3/+1 conviction), sell wall risk (-3/-1). Also updated reasoning string with new factors.

24. **Cross-dimensional: `buy_pressure_quality` analysis** — New function `detectBuyPressureSocialDivergence()` that fires `smart_money_accumulation` (buy pressure + bearish social) and `distribution_under_bullish_cover` (sell pressure + bullish social) divergence signals.

25. **Temporal analysis: 3 new tracked metrics** — holder_engagement_score, dex_liquidity, and reddit_activity_score now tracked in temporal delta comparison across scans.

26. **Engine version bump** — Updated to r62-2026-03-26 in templates.js to signal significant engine update.

27. **Frontend: sell wall risk badge** — Red/orange badge appears in price header area when sell_wall_risk is 'high' or 'elevated', shown before other badges.

28. **Frontend: 5 new market table rows** — holder_engagement_score, reddit_activity_score, bus_factor_score, sell_wall_risk, revenue_per_active_user all now appear in the market metrics table.

29. **Frontend: new red flag labels** — Added humanized labels for falling_social_velocity, secondary_coverage_only, no_github_large_cap, zero_volume_high_mcap, sell_pressure_dominance, ghost_contributors, old_ath_stagnation.

30. **Frontend: new alpha signal labels** — Added readable labels for news_acceleration, governance_activity, distributed_dev_plus_active_shipping, smart_money_accumulation, distribution_under_bullish_cover, community_score_leader.

- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 329 — Diff grid auto-fit (index.html)

- **Files:** scoring/category-weights.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 332 — Fix meme_token large-cap blending comment accuracy
- **Change:** Corrected comment on large-cap meme blending formula. Comment said "$1B = 10% L1" but formula actually produces 0% at $1B, reaching 30% at $10B (log10 scale). Formula is correct — comment was misleading.
- **Files:** scoring/category-weights.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 333 — Mercenary TVL breaker minimum mcap raised to $2M
- **Change:** Raised minimum mcap threshold for "mercenary TVL" circuit breaker from $500K to $2M. Below $2M, a 15x TVL/MCap ratio is noise not signal — micro-cap tokens have fragile mcap pricing and the imbalance is expected rather than alarming.
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 334 — Hack mentions circuit breaker: exclude passive targets
- **Change:** Added exclusion for meme, stablecoin, and wrapped tokens from the hack/exploit mentions circuit breaker. These token types frequently appear in ecosystem-level security news without being directly exploited, causing false caps.
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 335 — Onchain confidence N/A vs error distinction
- **Change:** When onchain collector has no error but also no data fields (non-DeFi token), onchainConf is now 50 (N/A, not applicable) instead of 0 (collection failure). This prevents overall_confidence from being artificially depressed for non-DeFi tokens that simply don't have TVL/fees.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 336 — Dev confidence N/A vs error distinction
- **Change:** Same fix as Round 335 for dev/GitHub confidence. Closed-source tokens with no GitHub data get devConf=50 (N/A) instead of 0. Prevents unnecessary overall_confidence deflation for legitimate closed-source projects.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 337 — Tiered completeness circuit breaker caps
- **Change:** Added a stricter cap (5.0) for extremely low data completeness (<20%). Previously only one threshold (<40% → 6.0). New tiers: <20% → cap 5.0 (speculative), <40% → cap 6.0 (insufficient).
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 338 — Red flag no_github: null check instead of falsy
- **Change:** Fixed `no_github` red flag detection to use `== null` instead of falsy check. Previously `github.stars = 0` (inactive but real repo) would trigger the flag incorrectly. A repo with 0 stars/commits is verifiable data, not missing data.
- **Files:** services/red-flags.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 339 — Red flag no_onchain_data: null check instead of falsy
- **Change:** Same fix for `no_onchain_data` — uses `== null` instead of falsy. TVL=0 is valid data for a new protocol with no locked capital. The old falsy check was incorrectly flagging new DeFi protocols as having no onchain data.
- **Files:** services/red-flags.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 340 — zero_social_mentions: require search evidence
- **Change:** `zero_social_mentions` now only fires if there's evidence the social search actually ran (sentiment_score, key_narratives, or bot_filtered_count present). Prevents false positives when the social collector never ran or returned an empty object.
- **Files:** services/red-flags.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 341 — Deflationary token tokenomics bonus
- **Change:** Added a small tokenomics score bonus for deflationary tokens (inflation_rate < 0, i.e. net token burns). Bonus capped at +0.5 to avoid over-rewarding aggressive burn programs. Maps: -10% inflation = +0.5 max bonus.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 342 — FDV unknown but low circulating supply: infer dilution risk
- **Change:** When FDV is unavailable but circulating supply is <50%, apply a mild -0.5 penalty to distribution score. Captures likely dilution risk even when FDV data is missing from the collector.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 343 — Volatility scoring: normalize across available timeframes
- **Change:** Fixed volatility calculation to not assume 0 for missing timeframes. Previously if only 24h data was available, 40% of the volatility signal was artificially zeroed out. Now normalizes to available timeframes only (24h-only = use 24h; 7d-only = use 7d; both = 0.6/0.4 weighted).
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 344 — CATEGORY_MAP: 16 new category slug mappings
- **Change:** Added 16 missing category slugs: staking, staking-pool, eth-staking, sol-staking, governance, governance-token, dao, launchpad, ido-platform, asset-management, portfolio-management, aggregator, dex-aggregator, swap-aggregator, and mapped infrastructure → infra_tooling (previously layer_1).
- **Files:** scoring/category-weights.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 345 — Fix holder field name mismatch (top10_holder_concentration_pct)
- **Change:** Critical bug fix: the holders collector outputs `top10_holder_concentration_pct` but circuit-breakers, red-flags, and scoring used `top10_concentration` and `concentration_pct`. Added the actual collector field name to all fallback chains so whale concentration data is actually used in scoring.
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js, services/red-flags.js, synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 346 — FDV/MCap circuit breaker: $1M minimum mcap
- **Change:** Added $1M minimum mcap to the FDV/MCap > 10x circuit breaker. Micro-cap tokens with high FDV ratios are already captured by the low_market_cap red flag and don't need a separate score cap.
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 347 — suspicious_volume_spike: $500K minimum absolute threshold
- **Change:** Added $500K absolute minimum to `suspicious_volume_spike` red flag. Small tokens with very low 7d average can produce technically-valid but meaningless spike ratios (e.g. $100 avg → $600 24h = 6x spike).
- **Files:** services/red-flags.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 348 — Zero CEX listings penalty for established tokens
- **Change:** Added mild -0.3 penalty in scoreMarketStrength when `exchange_count` is explicitly 0 (not missing) for tokens older than 6 months. Being known to have zero CEX listings after 6 months signals isolation/accessibility risk.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 349 — Holder confidence: stricter fallback (meaningful fields only)
- **Change:** Tightened holder confidence fallback: only gives 30% confidence if there are actual non-null, non-error data fields. An object with only `{ error: null }` no longer gets 30% partial credit.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 350 — Fix computePTVLAdjustment dead label statement
- **Change:** Fixed a dead JavaScript label statement `label: 'deep_value';` that was a syntactic no-op in the PTVL calculation. The variable assignment `label = 'deep_value'` on the next line was the actual working code. Cleaned up to single clear assignment.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 351 — computePTVLAdjustment: NaN guard
- **Change:** Added `Number.isFinite()` guards for mcap and tvl inputs to `computePTVLAdjustment`. Prevents NaN adjustment values when inputs are NaN (e.g. from safeNumber of undefined chain).
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 352 — scoreRisk: genesis_date validation
- **Change:** Added date validation before computing token age in `scoreRisk`. Guards against invalid dates, pre-2008 dates (pre-crypto era), and future dates — all of which would produce NaN or astronomically high age_months values.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 353 — scoreMarketStrength: genesis_date validation
- **Change:** Same date validation as Round 352 applied to `scoreMarketStrength` genesis_date age computation. Also guards against future dates causing negative age_months.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 354 — CATEGORY_MAP: infrastructure → infra_tooling (was layer_1)
- **Change:** Changed `infrastructure` slug mapping from `layer_1` to `infra_tooling`. The `infra_tooling` category has `development: 0.32` vs `layer_1: development: 0.22` — more accurate for B2B infrastructure protocols that are dev-activity driven rather than ecosystem adoption driven.
- **Files:** scoring/category-weights.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 355 — scoreOnchainHealth: remove duplicate feesCheck variable
- **Change:** Removed duplicate `feesCheck` variable that was identically computed as `fees`. The zero-fees TVL penalty now reuses the `fees` variable computed earlier in the function.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 356 — declining_tvl: null-safe check and granular severity
- **Change:** Fixed `declining_tvl` red flag to only fire when TVL change data actually exists (field != null). Added catastrophic tier: >70% decline = 'critical' (was 'warning' for >50%). Clearer messaging for catastrophic TVL collapses.
- **Files:** services/red-flags.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 357 — socialCredibility circuit breaker: fix safeN(null, null) = 0 bug
- **Change:** Critical bug fix: `safeN(null, null)` returns 0 (not null) because Number.isFinite(0) is true. The social credibility circuit breaker was checking `!== null` but could receive 0 (meaning "field not present") and activate falsely. Fixed to use direct field existence check before calling safeN.
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 358 — Fix false null guards for optional numeric fields (priceMomentumScore, realizedVol90d)
- **Change:** Fixed two instances of `safeNumber(field ?? null)` followed by `!== null` check — this pattern is broken because safeNumber(null) = 0 ≠ null so the guard is always true. Replaced with `if (field != null)` guard pattern. Applied to `price_momentum_score` and `realized_vol_90d`.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 359 — Fix false null guard for chainTvlDominance
- **Change:** Same fix as Round 358 for `chain_tvl_dominance_pct`. The `chainTvlDominance !== null` check was always true when using `safeNumber(... ?? null)`. Now uses `onchain.chain_tvl_dominance_pct != null` guard.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 360 — CATEGORY_MAP: 20 new category slug mappings
- **Change:** Added 20 new category mappings covering: web3-gaming, p2e, gamefi, infrastructure-middleware, middleware, cross-chain-messaging, interoperability, identity/DID protocols, insurance variants, credit protocols, synthetic assets, structured products, options/perpetual/margin trading, on-chain ETFs, tokenized equity/commodity. Improves categorization accuracy for newer DeFi verticals.

- **Tests:** 177/177 pass
