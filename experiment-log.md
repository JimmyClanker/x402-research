- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 2 — Moat instruction enriched with 5 moat types + DATA/PARTNERSHIP moat
- **Change:** Expanded moat instruction in buildOpusPrompt from 4 to 5 moat types (added DATA/PARTNERSHIP moat using top_tier_source_count + narrative_dominance_score), added specific sub-metrics for each moat type (bus_factor_score for dev moat, volume/liquidity ratio for liquidity moat, revenue > inflation for tokenomics moat), strengthened forbidden phrase enforcement.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 3 — project_summary instruction: explicit primary_chain guidance + multi-chain detection
- **Change:** Strengthened project_summary instruction in buildOpusPrompt to explicitly reference ecosystem.primary_chain, ecosystem.chains, and dex.dex_chains for blockchain identification. Added multi-chain protocol example. Added sentence 3 guidance to tie summary to moat or sector positioning. Result: Opus will consistently cite primary blockchain(s) in project_summary first sentence.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 4 — Quick report analysis_text: STRICT PARAGRAPH SCOPES like Opus
- **Change:** Strengthened analysis_text instruction in generateQuickReport to match Opus's strict paragraph scope template: Para 1 (verdict + top signal), Para 2 (2-3 supporting data points DIFFERENT from Para 1), Para 3 (outlook with concrete thresholds). Added NO REPETITION across paragraphs enforcement. Result: Grok fast will produce better-structured, less repetitive analysis.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 5 — validateReport: expanded forbidden moat phrases (9 patterns now)
- **Change:** Added 3 new forbidden moat phrase patterns in validateReport: "well-positioned" (without numbers), "experienced team" (without contributor count), "growing adoption/traction" (without growth rate). Total forbidden patterns now 9. Result: validateReport will catch more generic moat phrases and warn.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 6 — analysis_text Para 4 (OUTLOOK): threshold-based upgrade/downgrade guidance
- **Change:** Enriched Para 4 outlook instruction in buildOpusPrompt with concrete examples: "If TVL crosses $XM or fees sustain $Y/week, upgrade to BUY" OR "If price breaks $Z, downgrade to AVOID". Added explicit catalyst + risk trigger format. Result: Opus will produce more actionable, threshold-driven outlook paragraphs instead of vague "watch for updates" statements.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 7 — key_findings: enriched format with 3 comparative examples
- **Change:** Expanded key_findings instruction in buildOpusPrompt with 3 concrete examples (TVL growth, P/TVL vs sector, fee efficiency vs sector). Added explicit guidance to PRIORITIZE comparative findings when SECTOR_CONTEXT is available. Result: Opus will produce more investor-actionable key_findings with sector benchmarking instead of isolated metrics.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 112 — market.js: clamp volume_to_mcap_ratio to max 10 (wash trading guard)
- **Change:** Clamp volumeToMcapRatio to max 10 (1000% daily volume vs mcap). Extreme ratios (>10) are almost always wash trading or data errors. Also guard negative ratios.
- **Files:** collectors/market.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 111 — index.js: total collection time warning when duration_ms > 15s
- **Change:** Added warning log after result build if total collection time >15s. Logs slow collectors (>8s latency) by name. Helps identify rate-limit stalls or API performance issues.
- **Files:** collectors/index.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 110 — github.js: log rate limit remaining from x-ratelimit-remaining header
- **Change:** Added rate limit logging from response headers. Warns when remaining <100 calls. Helps preempt GitHub rate limit exhaustion.
- **Files:** collectors/github.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 109 — onchain.js: per-call latency logging for slow DeFiLlama endpoint detection
- **Change:** Added timing log around protocol+fees Promise.allSettled. Logs warning if duration >8s, helps diagnose rate-limit throttling or API performance issues.
- **Files:** collectors/onchain.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 108 — tokenomics.js: better fallback for missing vesting data (CoinGecko genesis_date)
- **Change:** Enhanced pluckVestingInfo() to fallback launch_date to marketData.genesis_date when Messari doesn't have consensus.launch_date. Added launch_date_source field to track origin (messari/coingecko_genesis).
- **Files:** collectors/tokenomics.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 107 — x-social.js: NaN guards + missing field defaults from Grok response
- **Change:** Added guards against NaN sentiment_score (default to 0), ensure all required fields (sentiment, mention_volume, key_narratives, notable_accounts, kol_sentiment, summary) have defaults when Grok returns partial data.
- **Files:** collectors/x-social.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 106 — fear-greed.js: in-memory cache with 1h TTL
- **Change:** Added module-level in-memory cache (cachedResult, cacheTimestamp) with 1h TTL. Fear & Greed updates once daily — no need to re-fetch for every project scan. Cache errors not stored (retry on next call).
- **Files:** collectors/fear-greed.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 105 — holders.js: better fallback + context when Etherscan returns no data
- **Change:** Detect "no data"/"no record" errors from Etherscan and provide clearer message (different chain / not indexed). Also handle empty holders array with explicit error explaining likely causes (new token, non-ERC20, wrong chain).
- **Files:** collectors/holders.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 104 — onchain.js: more informative error messages (network/rate-limit/server)
- **Change:** Enhanced error classifier in catch block to distinguish: rate limit (429), server error (503/500), network unreachable (ECONNREFUSED/ENOTFOUND), timeout vs generic error. Error messages now guide debugging.
- **Files:** collectors/onchain.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 103 — dexscreener.js: boosted pairs + token age + pair creation date
- **Change:** Added top_pair_boosted (DexScreener promo flag), top_pair_created_at (pair creation timestamp), top_pair_age_days (pair age in days). Signals new pairs vs established liquidity pools.
- **Files:** collectors/dexscreener.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 102 — index.js: NaN sanitizer pass + impossible value guards
- **Change:** Added sanitizeCollectorData() that replaces all NaN with null, guards negative prices/market caps/volumes/TVL, clamps extreme ratios (>1e12), and recursively cleans nested objects/arrays. Applied to all collectors before return.
- **Files:** collectors/index.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 101 — market.js: watchlist_portfolio_users + bid-ask spread parsing
- **Change:** Added CoinGecko watchlist_portfolio_users field (interest signal) and bid-ask spread stats (avg/median/count) from tickers for liquidity quality assessment. Both unused fields now surface valuable investor signals.
- **Files:** collectors/market.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 8 — catalysts: quantified impact estimates in format instruction
- **Change:** Enriched catalysts format instruction in buildOpusPrompt to include impact magnitude estimates (e.g., "+15-25% TVL inflow", "+30% price re-rating", "1.5-2x multiple expansion"). Added 3 new examples with quantified impacts derived from sector benchmarks. Added explicit "Quantify impact when comparable data exists" guidance. Result: Opus will produce more investor-actionable catalysts with expected return ranges instead of vague "could drive price up" statements.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 9 — risks: quantified downside magnitude estimates
- **Change:** Enriched risks format instruction in buildOpusPrompt to include concrete price impact magnitude (e.g., "-25-35% correction", "-15-20% cascade", "-40-60% bridge hack impact"). Added downside estimates to all 3 risk examples. Added explicit "Quantify downside when sector precedent or historical pattern exists" guidance. Result: Opus will produce more investor-actionable risks with expected loss ranges instead of vague "could drive price down" statements.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 10 — Score interpretation context guide in Opus prompt
- **Change:** Added SCORE_INTERPRETATION_GUIDE block to buildOpusPrompt user message. For each scoring dimension with data, provides a human-readable interpretation of what the score range means for investors (low/mid/high bands). Helps LLM write analysis that correctly interprets algorithmic scores instead of fabricating meaning.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 11 — validateReport: price change hallucination detection
- **Change:** Added post-processing validation in validateReport that checks price change percentages (24h, 7d, 30d) cited in analysis_text against RAW_DATA. Flags deviations >10 percentage points as possible hallucinations. Catches LLM inventing price moves that don't match reality.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 12 — validateReport: cross-reference bull/bear case numbers against RAW_DATA
- **Change:** Added validateThesisNumbers() helper that checks TVL, fees, and MCap claims in bull_case.thesis and bear_case.thesis against actual RAW_DATA. Flags >30% deviations as potential hallucinations. Catches LLM inventing on-chain metrics to support fabricated thesis arguments.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 13 — buildDataSummary: enhanced data gap warnings for LLM
- **Change:** Enhanced the DATA GAPS section in buildDataSummary with explicit per-collector warnings. When 2+ critical collectors fail, adds a CRITICAL DATA GAPS warning. Individual warnings for market, onchain, github, and tokenomics tell LLM explicitly what it CANNOT cite, preventing fabrication of missing data.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 14 — validateReport: FDV/MCap hallucination detection
- **Change:** Added validation for FDV/MCap ratio claims in analysis_text. Two checks: (1) if RAW_DATA has FDV/MCap, validates cited ratio is within 30% of reality; (2) if RAW_DATA has NO FDV data, flags any cited FDV/MCap ratio as hallucinated. Catches a common fabrication vector where LLMs invent dilution metrics.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 15 — buildDataSummary: fear & greed index context
- **Change:** Added MARKET SENTIMENT section to buildDataSummary using Fear & Greed Index data. Provides contextual interpretation of the index value (extreme greed/fear/neutral) and explicit guidance on how to factor broad market sentiment into verdict calibration. Prevents overly bullish calls in extreme greed and overly bearish calls in extreme fear.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 16 — validateReport: key_findings vs analysis_text overlap detection
- **Change:** Added detection for key_findings that simply repeat information already in analysis_text. Extracts core phrases from each finding and checks if they appear in the analysis paragraph. Warns when >2 findings overlap. Encourages LLM to make findings additive rather than redundant.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 17 — buildDataSummary: exchange listing context
- **Change:** Added EXCHANGE LISTINGS section to buildDataSummary showing exchange count with contextual labels. Zero exchanges flagged as DEX-only with liquidity warning. <5 = limited access. ≥10 = wide availability. Helps LLM factor accessibility/liquidity into analysis.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 18 — validateReport: sentiment fabrication when social data absent
- **Change:** Added detection for fabricated sentiment claims in analysis_text when no social collector data exists. Catches phrases like "strong bullish sentiment", "widely discussed", "growing community interest" when the social collector returned errors or empty data. One of the top hallucination vectors.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

### Round 19 — buildOpusPrompt: explicit no-data integrity + cross-section uniqueness rules
- **Change:** Added two new rules to Opus FINAL REMINDER: (13) NO-DATA INTEGRITY — explicit instruction to never fabricate data for missing collectors, always write "No data available" instead; (14) CROSS-SECTION UNIQUENESS — key_findings must not repeat analysis_text. Also added rules 6+7 to quick report FINAL REMINDER for the same purpose.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass
- **Result:** kept

## Experiment 1 — Social scoring confidence weighting
- **Hypothesis:** social score was too sensitive to small mention counts and thin sentiment samples.
- **Change:** replaced linear mention growth with log scaling; sentiment spread now gets confidence weighting from total signals; reasoning includes confidence.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Benchmark:**
  - baseline: ETH 6.0 / SOL 5.3 / AAVE 5.7
  - after change: ETH 6.0 / SOL 5.3 / AAVE 4.0
- **Result:** kept. More conservative on sparse social data; ETH/SOL remained in range.

## Experiment 2 — Completeness from metadata collectors
- **Hypothesis:** completeness should follow `metadata.collectors.ok`, not object presence only.
- **Change:** temporarily switched completeness to metadata-driven logic.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Benchmark:** ETH 4.3 / SOL 3.5 / AAVE 4.0
- **Result:** discarded and reverted. Penalized too aggressively for normal partial-data cases.

## Experiment 3 — Cache corruption resilience
- **Hypothesis:** malformed cached JSON should not take down alpha requests.
- **Change:** wrapped cache JSON parsing in `try/catch`; corrupted rows are deleted and treated as cache misses.
- **Files:** `routes/alpha.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better graceful degradation with zero API changes.

## Experiment 4 — LLM output normalization hardening
- **Hypothesis:** model output can drift from schema (invalid verdict casing/spacing, duplicated bullets).
- **Change:** normalized verdicts to allowed enum values and deduplicated/trimmed array fields.
- **Files:** `synthesis/llm.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Safer downstream formatting without changing the public API.

## Experiment 5 — Social narrative cleanup + recency ordering
- **Hypothesis:** narrative extraction included noisy project tokens, and recent news should prefer newest entries first.
- **Change:** replaced the useless literal `projectName` stopword with real project token filtering; added generic token/coin stopwords; sorted `recent_news` by descending date before truncating.
- **Files:** `collectors/social.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better signal quality and more sensible news ordering.

## Experiment 6 — Report completeness visibility
- **Hypothesis:** users should see generation time and data completeness immediately, not buried inside the overall score reasoning.
- **Change:** surfaced `generated_at` and overall completeness in the text and HTML report headers.
- **Files:** `synthesis/templates.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better readability with no JSON/API contract changes.

## Experiment 7 — Market score adds FDV overhang + ATH distance
- **Hypothesis:** raw momentum + volume was too generous for tokens with large unlock overhang or still deeply below ATH.
- **Change:** market scoring now factors `FDV/MC` dilution risk and distance from ATH, while preserving the existing liquidity/momentum blend.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Benchmark:** ETH 6.0 / SOL 5.2 / AAVE 4.9 (completeness 60/60/60)
- **Result:** kept. Better market-quality discrimination without breaking score ranges.

## Experiment 8 — Development score adds repo freshness + issue pressure
- **Hypothesis:** stars and commits alone miss stale repos and overloaded issue queues.
- **Change:** development scoring now considers forks, days since last commit, and a light `open_issues / commits_90d` pressure penalty.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Benchmark:** ETH 5.1 / SOL 5.0 / AAVE 4.9 on a later live run; results were network-variable because social/tokenomics were partially unavailable, but scoring remained stable and non-breaking.
- **Result:** kept. Adds a useful maintenance-quality signal with conservative penalties.

## Experiment 9 — Social collector query expansion + article-level sentiment
- **Hypothesis:** two Exa queries under-covered catalysts/adoption narratives, and keyword totals overcounted sentiment from single noisy articles.
- **Change:** expanded Exa query set to include catalysts and adoption coverage; switched sentiment aggregation from raw keyword counts to one vote per article; dedupe key now normalizes title fallback.
- **Files:** `collectors/social.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better data coverage and less sentiment inflation from repeated keywords.

## Experiment 10 — Onchain collector parallel discovery
- **Hypothesis:** chain detection and protocol-list discovery were serialized unnecessarily, increasing cold-start latency.
- **Change:** `collectOnchain()` now runs `tryChainTvl()` and the protocol list fetch in parallel before matching.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Small but clean latency win with no API changes.

## Experiment 11 — Data-quality summary surfaced in API/report + tokenomics slug coverage
- **Hypothesis:** users need faster visibility into partial-data conditions, and Messari lookups should try market name/symbol aliases, not only project/CoinGecko id.
- **Change:** added `data_quality` summary to alpha responses (completeness, failed collectors, latency bucket, duration), surfaced collector failures in text/HTML reports, and expanded Messari slug candidates with market `name` + `symbol`.
- **Files:** `routes/alpha.js`, `synthesis/templates.js`, `collectors/tokenomics.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better operator visibility on degraded runs and slightly wider tokenomics lookup coverage.

## Experiment 12 — Subtle chalkboard motion + hover polish
- **Hypothesis:** the page felt static; gentle reveal/hover effects can make the chalkboard UI feel more premium without breaking the minimalist style.
- **Change:** added layered chalkboard texture, panel sheen, fade-up entrance animation, and light hover elevation for buttons/panels/cards.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`
- **Validation:** inline script parsed via `vm.Script`; CSS/HTML syntax stayed valid.
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. More polished visual rhythm with very low UI risk.

## Experiment 13 — Responsive report layout and mobile market board
- **Hypothesis:** the desktop-first layout compressed too hard on phones, especially verdict/header blocks and the metric table.
- **Change:** refined breakpoints, stacked major grids earlier, made verdict/header blocks mobile-friendly, and converted the market board into a readable card-like stacked table on small screens.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`
- **Validation:** inline script parsed via `vm.Script`; responsive CSS remained syntactically valid.
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Better mobile readability without changing the API or data model.

## Experiment 14 — Radar chart readability upgrade
- **Hypothesis:** the radar was visually on-theme but hard to read quickly; better scale cues and point styling would make scoring easier to interpret.
- **Change:** enlarged the chart slightly, added clearer grid/tick labels, endpoint dots, a center anchor, glow treatment, and stronger per-axis point markers.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`
- **Validation:** inline script parsed via `vm.Script`; generated SVG markup stayed valid.
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. The score radar should scan faster while preserving the chalkboard look.

## Experiment 15 — Animated score bars with clearer hierarchy
- **Hypothesis:** the score rows lacked hierarchy and felt utilitarian; adding microcopy and animated fill would improve scanability.
- **Change:** turned score rows into mini cards, added label/tone hierarchy, and animated bar fill using CSS custom properties while keeping the same score data.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`
- **Validation:** inline script parsed via `vm.Script`; CSS animation syntax remained valid.
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Scores now read faster and look more intentional.

## Experiment 16 — Verdict badge/cards polish + HTML report template upgrade
- **Hypothesis:** the main verdict and exported HTML report still felt more functional than premium; bringing the same design language to both surfaces would improve perceived quality.
- **Change:** redesigned the live verdict as a more deliberate badge, upgraded insight cards with accent rails/background depth, and rebuilt the exported HTML report with a stronger chalkboard layout, header, and section cards.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`, `synthesis/templates.js`
- **Validation:** `public/alpha.html` inline JS parsed via `vm.Script`; `synthesis/templates.js` imported successfully.
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. UI and exported report now feel visually consistent and more professional.

## Experiment 17 — Tokenomics base score normalization + circulating supply cap
- **Hypothesis:** `scoreTokenomicsRisk` started at base 6 while all other dimensions used base 4-5, creating an upward bias. Also, `pct_circulating` wasn't capped at 100, allowing CoinGecko rounding artifacts (>100%) to add phantom bonus points.
- **Change:** aligned base to 5 (consistent with other dimensions), capped `pct_circulating` at 100, adjusted the bonus curve to `pct/40` (max +2.5 at 100%), added a small +0.3 bonus for available `roi_data`.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. More accurate tokenomics scores; no free points from data artifacts.

## Experiment 18 — GitHub collector: language, description, license, watchers fields
- **Hypothesis:** GitHub API already returns `language`, `description`, `license`, and `watchers_count` in the repo response, but the collector was discarding them. These fields are useful for LLM context and future scoring dimensions.
- **Change:** added `language`, `description`, `license`, `watchers` to `createEmptyGithubResult` and populated them from `repoData` in the return statement.
- **Files:** `collectors/github.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Richer GitHub data at zero API cost; backward compatible (new optional fields).

## Experiment 19 — Error-resilient scoring: safeCollector guard
- **Hypothesis:** collectors that return `{ error: "...", totalVolume: ... }` would still have their numeric fields scored. If the collector has an error key, those numbers are unreliable — scoring should treat them as missing.
- **Change:** added `safeCollector()` helper that returns `{}` for any collector with `error` set. Applied to all 5 scoring functions in `calculateScores`.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass; manual test confirmed error-keyed collectors score as 0-data.
- **Result:** kept. Prevents phantom scores from partially-failed collectors.

## Experiment 20 — Tokenomics timeout: per-collector fresh clock
- **Hypothesis:** tokenomics must await market before starting Messari calls. Wrapped inside the global `withTimeout`, the tokenomics collector could have < 12s left if market took 8+s. This causes unnecessary timeouts.
- **Change:** removed tokenomics from the main `Promise.allSettled` timeout; instead applied a fresh 12s `withTimeout` that starts only after market resolves via `.then()` chaining.
- **Files:** `collectors/index.js`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Tokenomics gets a full 12s window regardless of market latency.

## Experiment 21 — UX: GitHub card in market board + change colorization
- **Hypothesis:** the new `language`, `description`, `license`, and `watchers` fields collected in Exp 18 weren't visible anywhere in the UI. Also, TVL change % values would benefit from green/red coloring to instantly signal direction.
- **Change:** added `renderGithubCard()` function and CSS (`github-card`, `lang-badge`, `license-badge`, `stat-badge`); injected card below metric table. Added `pos-change`/`neg-change` CSS classes and `changeClass()` helper for TVL % rows.
- **Files:** `public/alpha.html`
- **Test:** `node --test test/*.test.js` → 15/15 pass
- **Result:** kept. Market board now surfaces repo context inline; direction coloring improves data scanability.

## AutoResearch Batch — 30 Rounds (2026-03-25 02:00 UTC)

### Round 1 — Social Collector: Keyword Expansion + Domain Trust Scoring
- **Change:** Expanded bullish/bearish keyword lists (+13 each); added `TRUSTED_DOMAINS` set (12 reputable crypto publications); weighted sentiment counts by domain trust score (1.4x for tier-1 sources vs 1.0x baseline); added new `unlock_mentions`/`exploit_mentions` query.
- **Files:** `collectors/social.js`
- **Tests:** 15/15 pass

### Round 2 — DexScreener Collector: Buy/Sell Pressure Signal
- **Change:** Added `buys_24h`, `sells_24h`, `buy_sell_ratio`, and `pressure_signal` ('buy_pressure'|'sell_pressure'|'balanced') by aggregating 24h txn counts across all DEX pairs.
- **Files:** `collectors/dexscreener.js`
- **Tests:** 15/15 pass

### Round 3 — Alpha Signals: DEX Pressure + Revenue-Generating Signals
- **Change:** Added two new alpha signal detectors: `dex_buy_pressure` (buy/sell ratio >= 1.15) and `revenue_generating` (fees_7d > $100K + efficiency > $50/M TVL/wk).
- **Files:** `services/alpha-signals.js`
- **Tests:** 15/15 pass

### Round 4 — Red Flags: DEX Sell Pressure + Low Liquidity + Concentration
- **Change:** Added three new red flags: `dex_sell_pressure` (ratio <= 0.87), `very_low_dex_liquidity` (< $50K), and `single_pool_liquidity_concentration` (> 90% in one pool).
- **Files:** `services/red-flags.js`
- **Tests:** 15/15 pass

### Round 5 — Scoring: Risk Dimension Incorporates DEX Buy/Sell Pressure
- **Change:** Added ±0.5/0.8 adjustment to risk score based on DEX pressure signal; reasonings now includes pressure ratio.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 15/15 pass

### Round 6 — Onchain Collector: TVL Stickiness Signal
- **Change:** Added `tvl_stickiness` field ('sticky'|'moderate'|'fleeing') based on 7d/30d TVL change thresholds. Sticky = capital retention, Fleeing = capital exit.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Tests:** 15/15 pass

### Round 7 — Scoring: Onchain Health Incorporates TVL Stickiness
- **Change:** Added ±0.4/0.5 adjustment to onchain_health score based on TVL stickiness signal.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 15/15 pass

### Round 8 — Templates: Surface DEX Pressure + TVL Stickiness in Reports
- **Change:** `extractKeyMetrics` now includes `dex_pressure`, `dex_buy_sell_ratio`, `tvl_stickiness`; text report surfaces these metrics in Key Metrics section.
- **Files:** `synthesis/templates.js`
- **Tests:** 15/15 pass

### Round 9 — Market Collector: ATL Distance % + Price Range Position
- **Change:** Added `atl_distance_pct` (+% above ATL) and `price_range_position` (0=ATL, 1=ATH) derived from ATL/ATH market data. Previously ATL was returned but distance wasn't computed.
- **Files:** `collectors/market.js`
- **Tests:** 15/15 pass

### Round 10 — Scoring: Market Strength Uses Price Range Position
- **Change:** Added ±0.3/0.6 adjustment based on `price_range_position` — near ATH confirms momentum, near ATL signals capitulation risk.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`

- **Files:** `scoring/category-weights.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 123 — calculateConfidence: add holder + dex confidence, graduated tokenomics scoring

- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 124 — scoreMarketStrength: empty data guard → neutral 5.0
- **Change:** When no price, volume, or market cap data exists, return 5.0 neutral instead of computing from zero values (which produced erratic low scores).
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 125 — scoreOnchainHealth: cap TVL changes to ±200%
- **Change:** TVL changes capped to [-200%, +200%] before scoring to prevent extreme new protocol launches (e.g. +10000%) or exploits (-99%) from dominating the score.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 126 — scoreDevelopment: missing github → 3.0 (unknown) not 4.0
- **Change:** When no GitHub data exists, return 3.0 instead of computing from base 4.0. Absence of dev evidence is mildly concerning, not neutral. Reasoning explicitly states "unverifiable".
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 127 — circuit-breakers: DeFi ghost protocol + extreme low token velocity
- **Change:** Two new warning breakers: (1) DeFi with TVL > $100M and zero social mentions → cap 6.5; (2) token velocity < 0.01% daily turnover → cap 6.0. Also added missing safeN helper.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 128 — red-flags: suspicious volume spike (5x MA) + team wallet spike
- **Change:** Two new red flags: (1) 24h volume > 5x 7-day average = possible wash trading/exit pump; (2) team/treasury wallet activity > $1M = insider selling risk.
- **Files:** `services/red-flags.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 129 — scoreTokenomicsRisk: no-data guard → neutral 5.0
- **Change:** When tokenomics has no usable numerical fields (pct_circulating, inflation_rate, token_distribution), return 5.0 neutral. Partial data (error + fallback values) still scores normally.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 130 — Commit R121-130
- **Commit:** 6894813 — 152 lines changed. Pushed to main.

### Round 131 — scoreDistribution: no-data guard → neutral 5.0
- **Change:** When no distribution-relevant data exists (pct_circulating, token_distribution, FDV/MCap pair), return 5.0 neutral instead of computing from partial data that defaults to 5.0 anyway with wrong reasoning.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 132 — circuit-breakers: persistent DeFi revenue collapse breaker
- **Change:** New warning breaker: if 7d revenue declined > 50% vs prior 7d AND monthly rate also declining, cap at 6.5. Renamed conflicting `fees7d` variable to `fees7dR132`.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 133 — red-flags: staking APY divergence detection

- **Files:** `services/red-flags.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 134 — scoreRisk: empty data guard → neutral 5.0
- **Change:** When no risk-relevant fields are present (no price changes, no DEX data, no holder data, no genesis date), return 5.0 instead of optimistic 6.0. Unknown risk ≠ low risk.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 135 — scoreOnchainHealth: no-data guard → neutral 5.0
- **Change:** Many tokens are not DeFi protocols and have no TVL/fees. Instead of penalizing them with 4.0, return neutral 5.0 with "not applicable" reasoning.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 136 — category-weights: meme_token large-cap blending with L1 weights
- **Change:** High-mcap meme tokens ($1B+) blend meme weights with L1 weights proportionally (max 30% blend at $10B+). Prevents DOGE/SHIB-level assets from being evaluated purely as social tokens.
- **Files:** `scoring/category-weights.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 137 — calculateConfidence: graduated market scoring (5 fields, max 100)

- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 138 — calculateConfidence: graduated onchain and social scoring
- **Change:** Onchain: graduated by tvl/fees/revenue/trend (30+25+25+20). Social: graduated by mention volume/sentiment/narratives/quality (40+30+20+10).
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 139 — calculateConfidence: graduated dev (github) scoring
- **Change:** Dev confidence graduated: commits_90d 30pts, contributors 25pts, stars 20pts, last_commit 15pts, forks 10pts. Previously binary (0/50/100).

- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 140 — Commit R131-140
- **Commit:** 4eae3ac — 143 lines changed. Pushed to main.

### Round 141 — circuit-breakers: DEX liquidity $10K-$50K → warning cap 5.5
- **Change:** Added intermediate breaker zone: DEX liquidity between $10K and $50K caps at 5.5 (extreme slippage risk, not quite untradeable).
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 142 — scoreMarketStrength: smooth ATH distance penalty (no cliff at -80%)
- **Change:** Replaced binary cliff penalty at -80% ATH with smooth linear gradient from -50% to -95%, max -1.5 pts. Prevents harsh jumps for tokens near but not at -80%.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 143 — red-flags: unsupported price pump detection
- **Change:** New red flag: price +300% in 30d without TVL or fee backing. Critical at +1000%, warning otherwise. Catches unsustainable pump patterns.
- **Files:** `services/red-flags.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 144 — scoreMarketStrength: null-aware momentum calculation
- **Change:** Momentum now only counts non-null price_change fields. When all are null, momentum = 0 (neutral) instead of 0 from false zero values. Weights renormalize to available fields.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 145 — scoreMarketStrength: null-aware trend consistency
- **Change:** Trend consistency only counts non-null timeframes. When no price_change data, consistency = 0.5 (neutral) instead of 0.0.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 146 — category-weights: add cross_chain_bridge and derivatives categories
- **Change:** Two new weight profiles: cross_chain_bridge (risk weight 18% — bridges are top exploit vector) and derivatives (onchain 30% — volume/usage is primary signal). Updated CATEGORY_MAP with bridge/derivatives/perpetuals slugs.
- **Files:** `scoring/category-weights.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 147 — scoreRisk: volatility capping at 200% + extreme volatility tier
- **Change:** Cap change inputs at 200% to prevent absurd pump/dump values dominating. Added extreme tier: volatility > 100% = -3.0 pts (possible exploit).
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 148 — circuit-breakers: extended stablecoin symbol list
- **Change:** Added 10 more stablecoin symbols (CRVUSD, GHO, USDN, DOLA, BEAN, CUSD, USDS, USDZ, USDM, ZUSD, USDV) to de-peg detection.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

### Round 149 — scoreOnchainHealth: zero-fees penalty for DeFi with TVL
- **Change:** Protocols with TVL > $10M and zero fees penalized -1.5 pts. TVL > $1M and zero fees: -0.7 pts. Mercenary capital with no value capture = structurally weak.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 164/164 pass

## Experiment 26 — CATEGORY_LEADER_SHIFT: score_gap
- **Hypothesis:** Score gap between new/old #1 indicates strength of regime change (large gap = dominant new leader).
- **Change:** Added score_gap (new_leader_score - old_leader_score) to detail and data_json.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Adds quality context to leadership shifts.

## Experiment 27 — BREAKER_ALERT: multiple breakers count + severity escalation
- **Hypothesis:** 3+ active breakers is critical risk; count provides context on token health.
- **Change:** Severity = critical (3+ breakers) | high (1-2); included breaker_count and all_breakers list in data_json.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Severity escalates with breaker count; full list logged for analysis.

## Experiment 28 — BREAKER_ALERT: duration check + severity escalation
- **Hypothesis:** Breaker active >48h (3+ snapshots) indicates persistent structural issue; should escalate to critical.
- **Change:** Check last 4 snapshots; if breaker present in 2+ previous = long_duration → severity = critical.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Persistent breakers flagged as critical; transient breakers remain high.

## Experiment 29 — DIVERGENCE: moderate divergence thresholds
- **Hypothesis:** Score 6.5/4.5 capture moderate divergence earlier; severity scale provides quality filter.
- **Change:** Lowered thresholds to 6.5 (positive) and 4.5 (negative); severity = high (extreme score ≥7.0/≤4.0), medium (moderate 6.5-7.0/4.0-4.5).
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Broader coverage with quality tier.

## Experiment 30 — DIVERGENCE: volume quality filter
- **Hypothesis:** Divergence on thin volume (<5% daily turnover) is less actionable; severity should downgrade.
- **Change:** Added volume_to_mcap calculation; low_volume flag downgrades high → medium severity.
- **Files:** oracle/signal-detector.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Volume context improves signal quality filtering.

## Experiment 31 — Alpha Signals: CONVICTION_SCORE composite
- **Hypothesis:** 5+ strong signals indicate high conviction; composite bonus rewards multiple confluent strong signals.
- **Change:** getSignalStrengthScore adds +10 bonus per strong signal beyond 4th when strongCount ≥ 5.
- **Files:** services/alpha-signals.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Multi-signal conviction rewarded in strength score.

## Experiment 32 — Alpha Signals: SUPPLY_SHOCK
- **Hypothesis:** Low circulating supply (<30% total) + low FDV/MCap (<2x) signals compressed float with low overhang.
- **Change:** Added supply_shock signal checking circulating_supply % and FDV/MCap ratio.
- **Files:** services/alpha-signals.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Identifies supply compression conditions early.

## Experiment 33 — Alpha Signals: CROSS_CHAIN_TVL_GROWTH
- **Hypothesis:** Simultaneous TVL growth across multiple chains signals broad capital migration, not single-chain flukes.
- **Change:** Added cross_chain_tvl_growth signal for 2+ chains growing >15% TVL in 7d.
- **Files:** services/alpha-signals.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Detects multichain momentum early.

## Experiment 34 — Trade Setup: volatility-adjusted entry zone
- **Hypothesis:** Entry zone should adapt to recent volatility — wider for volatile tokens, tighter for stable.
- **Change:** Entry spread = 3% (low vol <5%), 5% (normal), 8% (high vol >20%) based on |price_change_7d|.
- **Files:** services/trade-setup.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Entry zones adapt to market conditions.

## Experiment 35 — Trade Setup: dynamic SL based on volatility
- **Hypothesis:** Fixed -15% SL is too tight for volatile tokens, too wide for stable. Adapt to 7d price change.
- **Change:** SL = -10% (low vol <10%), -15% (normal), -25% (high vol >30%); ATL override if closer.
- **Files:** services/trade-setup.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. Stop losses adapt to token volatility profile.

## Experiment 36 — Trade Setup: Fibonacci TP targets
- **Hypothesis:** Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 61.8%, 100% ATH) provide better technical TP targets than fixed % gains.
- **Change:** TP1/TP2/TP3 use Fibonacci ATL→ATH levels when available, fallback to % gains otherwise.
- **Files:** services/trade-setup.js
- **Test:** npm test → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** keeper. TP targets align with technical support/resistance levels.

## Experiment 37 — Deduplicate safeNum/safeNumber into utils/math.js
- **Hypothesis:** `safeNum()` in collectors/market.js and `safeNumber()` in synthesis/scoring.js are identical utility functions; consolidating them reduces code duplication and establishes a shared numeric utilities module.
- **Change:** Created `utils/math.js` with a single `safeNumber(value, fallback=0)` function; updated imports in `collectors/market.js` and `synthesis/scoring.js`; renamed all `safeNum(...)` calls in market.js to `safeNumber(...)`.
- **Files:** utils/math.js (new), collectors/market.js, synthesis/scoring.js
- **Test:** `npm test` → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** kept. Shared utility module established; deduplication successful.


## Experiment 38 — JSDoc on all public exports in utils/
- **Hypothesis:** Security and math utility exports lack documentation; JSDoc improves code navigability and IDE autocomplete support.
- **Change:** Added JSDoc to `secureCompare()` in `utils/security.js` (format.js and math.js already had JSDoc).
- **Files:** utils/security.js
- **Test:** `npm test` → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** kept. All utils/ public functions now documented.


## Experiment 39 — JSDoc on createExaService in services/exa.js
- **Hypothesis:** Public API exports without JSDoc reduce code navigability and IDE autocomplete support.

- **Files:** services/exa.js
- **Test:** `npm test` → 177/177 pass
- **Result:** kept. Public service factory now documented.


## 2026-03-26 — AutoResearch Nightly Batch (Round 237 series, 30 improvements)

### Overview
30-round autonomous improvement batch targeting collector accuracy, scoring refinements, red flag detection, frontend UX, cross-dimensional analysis, and new data signals.

### Improvements Implemented

1. **Social: `competitor_content_ratio`** — New field tracking what fraction of articles frame the project in competitor context. High ratio (>60%) signals secondary coverage, not primary narrative. Used in scoring and red flags.

2. **Red flags: `falling_social_velocity`** — Fires when news_momentum is 'declining' AND sentiment_score < -0.2. Combination of declining coverage + bearish tone = fading narrative. Also added `secondary_coverage_only` info flag.

3. **Alpha signals: `community_score_leader`, `news_acceleration`, `governance_activity`** — Three new signals: top CoinGecko community score (>70), accelerating news coverage (>3 articles in 3 days), and active DAO governance (≥3 mentions).

4. **Circuit breakers: `zero_volume_high_mcap`, `no_github_large_cap`** — Zero 24h volume with high market cap triggers CRITICAL cap (4.0). No GitHub on >$50M cap token (non-meme) triggers WARNING cap (6.5).

5. **DexScreener: `sell_wall_risk`** — Composite signal detecting sell walls: high sell dominance + concentrated pool + accelerating volume = 'high' / 'elevated' / null. Used in scoring, LLM prompt, circuit breakers, and UI.

6. **Scoring social: `competitor_content_ratio` penalty** — When 50%+ of social coverage is competitor-framing, raw score penalized by up to -0.4.

7. **Market: `holder_engagement_score`** — New 0-100 composite combining volume/mcap velocity (50pts), community following (30pts), and trending bonus (20pts). Added to templates, UI metrics table, conviction scoring.

8. **LLM prompt: sell wall risk context block** — When DEX sell_wall_risk is 'elevated' or 'high', a dedicated ## SELL WALL RISK block appears in Opus prompt with actionable context for bear case.

9. **Report quality: sell wall + social credibility** — Adds issues for high sell wall risk and low social credibility + declining momentum, with score deduction.

10. **Templates: sell wall + holder engagement in text report** — Text report now shows ⚠️ Sell Wall Risk: HIGH/ELEVATED and Holder Engagement: X/100 in key metrics section.

11. **Reddit: upvote-weighted sentiment + `reddit_activity_score`** — Reddit sentiment now blends raw counts (60%) with log-scale upvote weights (40%). New `reddit_activity_score` (0-100) combines post count, upvote weight, recency, and subreddit diversity. Used in social scoring and confidence.

12. **Scoring distribution: `sell_wall_risk` penalty** — Applied directly in calculateScores() via distribution.score -= 0.6/0.3 for high/elevated sell wall risk.

13. **GitHub: `bus_factor_score`** — Gini-coefficient based (0-100) continuous score for contribution distribution. More nuanced than the categorical label. Used in dev dimension scoring.

14. **Dev scoring: `bus_factor_score` supplement** — Uses continuous Gini score to fine-tune dev dimension: <30 = penalty, >70 = bonus (only when label not already applied).

15. **Narrative momentum: 2026 AI narratives** — Added 5 new narrative clusters: `agent_commerce` (x402/A2A/MCP), `bitcoin_mainstream` (strategic reserve), `base_ecosystem`, `hyper_liquid` (Hyperliquid perps), `rwa_tokenization` (tokenized real estate/bonds).

16. **Social confidence: `reddit_activity_score` boost** — When reddit_activity_score ≥ 30, socialConf += 10, improving confidence on well-discussed tokens.

17. **LLM fact registry: 5 new facts** — Added holder_engagement_score, reddit_activity_score, competitor_content_ratio, sell_wall_risk, bus_factor_score to fact registry for LLM grounding.

18. **LLM data summary: sell wall risk in DEX section** — When sell_wall_risk is elevated/high, surfaces it prominently in the DEX section with ratio and volume momentum context.

19. **LLM data summary: engagement metrics block** — New ENGAGEMENT METRICS section shows holder_engagement_score and reddit_activity_score with human-readable labels when available.

20. **Alpha signals: `distributed_dev_plus_active_shipping`** — Fires when bus_factor_score ≥ 75 AND has_recent_release = true. Signals well-distributed team actively shipping = reduced key-person risk.

21. **Onchain: `revenue_per_active_user` + `active_addresses_7d`** — New product-market fit metric: daily revenue / daily active users. Also adds `active_addresses_7d` derived from daily active users × 7 × 0.6 uniqueness factor.

22. **Onchain scoring: `revenue_per_active_user` signal** — ≥$1/user/day = +0.4, ≥$0.10 = +0.2, ≥$0.01 = +0.05, <$0.01 = -0.1.

23. **Conviction: `holder_engagement_score` + sell wall bonuses** — High holder engagement (+3/+1 conviction), sell wall risk (-3/-1). Also updated reasoning string with new factors.

24. **Cross-dimensional: `buy_pressure_quality` analysis** — New function `detectBuyPressureSocialDivergence()` that fires `smart_money_accumulation` (buy pressure + bearish social) and `distribution_under_bullish_cover` (sell pressure + bullish social) divergence signals.

25. **Temporal analysis: 3 new tracked metrics** — holder_engagement_score, dex_liquidity, and reddit_activity_score now tracked in temporal delta comparison across scans.

26. **Engine version bump** — Updated to r62-2026-03-26 in templates.js to signal significant engine update.

27. **Frontend: sell wall risk badge** — Red/orange badge appears in price header area when sell_wall_risk is 'high' or 'elevated', shown before other badges.

28. **Frontend: 5 new market table rows** — holder_engagement_score, reddit_activity_score, bus_factor_score, sell_wall_risk, revenue_per_active_user all now appear in the market metrics table.

29. **Frontend: new red flag labels** — Added humanized labels for falling_social_velocity, secondary_coverage_only, no_github_large_cap, zero_volume_high_mcap, sell_pressure_dominance, ghost_contributors, old_ath_stagnation.

30. **Frontend: new alpha signal labels** — Added readable labels for news_acceleration, governance_activity, distributed_dev_plus_active_shipping, smart_money_accumulation, distribution_under_bullish_cover, community_score_leader.

- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 307 — Skeleton panel padding fluid
- **Change:** `.skeleton-panel { padding: clamp(16px, 2.5vw, 28px) }` allineato con `.panel` per coerenza visiva tra stato loading e stato risultati.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 308 — Skeleton lines proporzioni realistiche
- **Change:** Dimensioni skeleton aggiornate: title 40px (era 44px), badge 34px/26% (era 36px/28%), skeleton-bar 11px (era 10px). Aggiunta variante `.w-90`.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 309 — Loading wrap più largo
- **Change:** `.loading-wrap { width: min(640px, 100%) }` (era 560px). Gap tra elementi 10px (era 8px). Loading dots gap 6px.

- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 310 — Status box min-height per anti-CLS
- **Change:** `.status:not(:empty) { min-height: 80px }` previene layout shift quando la loading bar appare.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 311 — Results reveal easing spring
- **Change:** `resultsReveal` usa `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` (spring easing), durata 0.6s (era 0.55s). Y offset 22px (era 18px) per reveal più drammatico.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 312 — Panel stagger easing aggiornato
- **Change:** `panelSlideIn` per `#report .panel` usa `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. Delays leggermente ridotti (0.03s–0.33s).
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 313 — PanelSlideIn Y offset
- **Change:** `panelSlideIn` from: `translateY(16px) scale(0.993)` (era 14px/0.995) per slide-in più percettibile.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 314 — Score bar fill spring easing
- **Change:** `.bar > span` animation usa `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` e durata 0.9s (era 1s ease). Barre che si riempiono con feeling più naturale.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 315 — Card hover transition consistente
- **Change:** `.card` e `.score-row` hanno `transition` esplicita per hover. `.card:hover` aggiunge `transform: translateY(-1px)`. Hover states più coerenti.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 316 — Payment overlay overscroll-behavior
- **Change:** `.payment-overlay { overscroll-behavior: contain }` previene scroll bleed sotto il modal di pagamento.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 317 — Pay button WCAG AA contrast
- **Change:** `.pay-btn` colore `#f5a56b` (più chiaro/contrastato su sfondo scuro), `min-height: 52px` per touch target, `font-weight: 600`.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 318 — Dex dropdown item touch target + focus
- **Change:** `.dex-item { min-height: 48px }` per touch comfort. Aggiunto `:focus-visible` con outline arancione per accessibilità keyboard.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 319 — Products grid auto-fit (index.html)
- **Change:** `.products-grid` da `repeat(3, 1fr)` a `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(280px,100%), 1fr))` per layout fluido senza media query.
- **Files:** public/index.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 320 — Testimonial footer con accent line (index.html)
- **Change:** `.testimonial-card footer` ora ha `display:flex; gap:6px` con `::before` che inserisce una linea arancione di 16px prima del testo. Attribuisce più peso visivo alle citazioni.
- **Files:** public/index.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 321 — Rescan button touch target e hover lift
- **Change:** `.rescan-btn { min-height: 40px; display:inline-flex; align-items:center; gap:6px }` + hover `transform: translateY(-1px)`.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 322 — Hero note layout flex

- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 324 — Verdict badge pop animation
- **Change:** `.verdict` ha `animation: verdictPop 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) 0.3s both` — scala da 0.8 a 1 con delay per reveal drammatico dopo il report.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 325 — Project intro card visual hierarchy
- **Change:** `.project-intro-card` gradient migliorato (160deg, più scuro), border `rgba(212,88,10,0.2)`, `box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)`, padding 18px/20px.
- **Files:** public/alphascan.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 326 — Signal card hover (signals.html)
- **Change:** `.signal-card` aggiunto hover con `border-color: rgba(212,88,10,0.25); transform: translateY(-2px)` per coerenza con il design system.
- **Files:** public/signals.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 327 — Stats hover lift (signals.html)
- **Change:** `.stat:hover { transform: translateY(-2px); box-shadow: 0 8px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.25) }` per più feedback visivo.
- **Files:** public/signals.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 328 — Filters touch-friendly + focus ring (signals.html)
- **Change:** Select/input filtri: `min-height: 40px`, `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(212,88,10,0.12)` su focus, `border-color` su hover.
- **Files:** public/signals.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 329 — Diff grid auto-fit (index.html)
- **Change:** `.diff-grid` da `repeat(3, 1fr)` a `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(240px,100%), 1fr))` per layout fluido.
- **Files:** public/index.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 330 — will-change esteso a testimonial cards (index.html)
- **Change:** Aggiunto `.testimonial-card` a `will-change: transform` per hint GPU su hover animations.
- **Files:** public/index.html
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 331 — Fix CATEGORY_MAP duplicate keys
- **Change:** Removed 7 duplicate keys in CATEGORY_MAP that were silently overwriting correct mappings: `bridge`, `derivatives`, `perpetuals`, `cross-chain`, `rollup`, `prediction-market`, `liquid-staking`. Also cleaned up obsolete early entries that mapped bridge→defi_dex and prediction-market→defi_dex (later rounds had added correct mappings but originals remained as dead overrides).
- **Files:** scoring/category-weights.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 332 — Fix meme_token large-cap blending comment accuracy
- **Change:** Corrected comment on large-cap meme blending formula. Comment said "$1B = 10% L1" but formula actually produces 0% at $1B, reaching 30% at $10B (log10 scale). Formula is correct — comment was misleading.
- **Files:** scoring/category-weights.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 333 — Mercenary TVL breaker minimum mcap raised to $2M
- **Change:** Raised minimum mcap threshold for "mercenary TVL" circuit breaker from $500K to $2M. Below $2M, a 15x TVL/MCap ratio is noise not signal — micro-cap tokens have fragile mcap pricing and the imbalance is expected rather than alarming.
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 334 — Hack mentions circuit breaker: exclude passive targets
- **Change:** Added exclusion for meme, stablecoin, and wrapped tokens from the hack/exploit mentions circuit breaker. These token types frequently appear in ecosystem-level security news without being directly exploited, causing false caps.
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 335 — Onchain confidence N/A vs error distinction
- **Change:** When onchain collector has no error but also no data fields (non-DeFi token), onchainConf is now 50 (N/A, not applicable) instead of 0 (collection failure). This prevents overall_confidence from being artificially depressed for non-DeFi tokens that simply don't have TVL/fees.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 336 — Dev confidence N/A vs error distinction
- **Change:** Same fix as Round 335 for dev/GitHub confidence. Closed-source tokens with no GitHub data get devConf=50 (N/A) instead of 0. Prevents unnecessary overall_confidence deflation for legitimate closed-source projects.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 337 — Tiered completeness circuit breaker caps
- **Change:** Added a stricter cap (5.0) for extremely low data completeness (<20%). Previously only one threshold (<40% → 6.0). New tiers: <20% → cap 5.0 (speculative), <40% → cap 6.0 (insufficient).
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 338 — Red flag no_github: null check instead of falsy
- **Change:** Fixed `no_github` red flag detection to use `== null` instead of falsy check. Previously `github.stars = 0` (inactive but real repo) would trigger the flag incorrectly. A repo with 0 stars/commits is verifiable data, not missing data.
- **Files:** services/red-flags.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 339 — Red flag no_onchain_data: null check instead of falsy
- **Change:** Same fix for `no_onchain_data` — uses `== null` instead of falsy. TVL=0 is valid data for a new protocol with no locked capital. The old falsy check was incorrectly flagging new DeFi protocols as having no onchain data.
- **Files:** services/red-flags.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 340 — zero_social_mentions: require search evidence
- **Change:** `zero_social_mentions` now only fires if there's evidence the social search actually ran (sentiment_score, key_narratives, or bot_filtered_count present). Prevents false positives when the social collector never ran or returned an empty object.
- **Files:** services/red-flags.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 341 — Deflationary token tokenomics bonus
- **Change:** Added a small tokenomics score bonus for deflationary tokens (inflation_rate < 0, i.e. net token burns). Bonus capped at +0.5 to avoid over-rewarding aggressive burn programs. Maps: -10% inflation = +0.5 max bonus.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 342 — FDV unknown but low circulating supply: infer dilution risk
- **Change:** When FDV is unavailable but circulating supply is <50%, apply a mild -0.5 penalty to distribution score. Captures likely dilution risk even when FDV data is missing from the collector.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 343 — Volatility scoring: normalize across available timeframes
- **Change:** Fixed volatility calculation to not assume 0 for missing timeframes. Previously if only 24h data was available, 40% of the volatility signal was artificially zeroed out. Now normalizes to available timeframes only (24h-only = use 24h; 7d-only = use 7d; both = 0.6/0.4 weighted).
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 344 — CATEGORY_MAP: 16 new category slug mappings
- **Change:** Added 16 missing category slugs: staking, staking-pool, eth-staking, sol-staking, governance, governance-token, dao, launchpad, ido-platform, asset-management, portfolio-management, aggregator, dex-aggregator, swap-aggregator, and mapped infrastructure → infra_tooling (previously layer_1).
- **Files:** scoring/category-weights.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 345 — Fix holder field name mismatch (top10_holder_concentration_pct)
- **Change:** Critical bug fix: the holders collector outputs `top10_holder_concentration_pct` but circuit-breakers, red-flags, and scoring used `top10_concentration` and `concentration_pct`. Added the actual collector field name to all fallback chains so whale concentration data is actually used in scoring.
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js, services/red-flags.js, synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 346 — FDV/MCap circuit breaker: $1M minimum mcap
- **Change:** Added $1M minimum mcap to the FDV/MCap > 10x circuit breaker. Micro-cap tokens with high FDV ratios are already captured by the low_market_cap red flag and don't need a separate score cap.
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 347 — suspicious_volume_spike: $500K minimum absolute threshold
- **Change:** Added $500K absolute minimum to `suspicious_volume_spike` red flag. Small tokens with very low 7d average can produce technically-valid but meaningless spike ratios (e.g. $100 avg → $600 24h = 6x spike).
- **Files:** services/red-flags.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 348 — Zero CEX listings penalty for established tokens
- **Change:** Added mild -0.3 penalty in scoreMarketStrength when `exchange_count` is explicitly 0 (not missing) for tokens older than 6 months. Being known to have zero CEX listings after 6 months signals isolation/accessibility risk.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 349 — Holder confidence: stricter fallback (meaningful fields only)
- **Change:** Tightened holder confidence fallback: only gives 30% confidence if there are actual non-null, non-error data fields. An object with only `{ error: null }` no longer gets 30% partial credit.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 350 — Fix computePTVLAdjustment dead label statement
- **Change:** Fixed a dead JavaScript label statement `label: 'deep_value';` that was a syntactic no-op in the PTVL calculation. The variable assignment `label = 'deep_value'` on the next line was the actual working code. Cleaned up to single clear assignment.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 351 — computePTVLAdjustment: NaN guard
- **Change:** Added `Number.isFinite()` guards for mcap and tvl inputs to `computePTVLAdjustment`. Prevents NaN adjustment values when inputs are NaN (e.g. from safeNumber of undefined chain).
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 352 — scoreRisk: genesis_date validation
- **Change:** Added date validation before computing token age in `scoreRisk`. Guards against invalid dates, pre-2008 dates (pre-crypto era), and future dates — all of which would produce NaN or astronomically high age_months values.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 353 — scoreMarketStrength: genesis_date validation
- **Change:** Same date validation as Round 352 applied to `scoreMarketStrength` genesis_date age computation. Also guards against future dates causing negative age_months.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 354 — CATEGORY_MAP: infrastructure → infra_tooling (was layer_1)
- **Change:** Changed `infrastructure` slug mapping from `layer_1` to `infra_tooling`. The `infra_tooling` category has `development: 0.32` vs `layer_1: development: 0.22` — more accurate for B2B infrastructure protocols that are dev-activity driven rather than ecosystem adoption driven.
- **Files:** scoring/category-weights.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 355 — scoreOnchainHealth: remove duplicate feesCheck variable
- **Change:** Removed duplicate `feesCheck` variable that was identically computed as `fees`. The zero-fees TVL penalty now reuses the `fees` variable computed earlier in the function.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 356 — declining_tvl: null-safe check and granular severity
- **Change:** Fixed `declining_tvl` red flag to only fire when TVL change data actually exists (field != null). Added catastrophic tier: >70% decline = 'critical' (was 'warning' for >50%). Clearer messaging for catastrophic TVL collapses.
- **Files:** services/red-flags.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 357 — socialCredibility circuit breaker: fix safeN(null, null) = 0 bug
- **Change:** Critical bug fix: `safeN(null, null)` returns 0 (not null) because Number.isFinite(0) is true. The social credibility circuit breaker was checking `!== null` but could receive 0 (meaning "field not present") and activate falsely. Fixed to use direct field existence check before calling safeN.
- **Files:** scoring/circuit-breakers.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 358 — Fix false null guards for optional numeric fields (priceMomentumScore, realizedVol90d)
- **Change:** Fixed two instances of `safeNumber(field ?? null)` followed by `!== null` check — this pattern is broken because safeNumber(null) = 0 ≠ null so the guard is always true. Replaced with `if (field != null)` guard pattern. Applied to `price_momentum_score` and `realized_vol_90d`.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 359 — Fix false null guard for chainTvlDominance
- **Change:** Same fix as Round 358 for `chain_tvl_dominance_pct`. The `chainTvlDominance !== null` check was always true when using `safeNumber(... ?? null)`. Now uses `onchain.chain_tvl_dominance_pct != null` guard.
- **Files:** synthesis/scoring.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 360 — CATEGORY_MAP: 20 new category slug mappings
- **Change:** Added 20 new category mappings covering: web3-gaming, p2e, gamefi, infrastructure-middleware, middleware, cross-chain-messaging, interoperability, identity/DID protocols, insurance variants, credit protocols, synthetic assets, structured products, options/perpetual/margin trading, on-chain ETFs, tokenized equity/commodity. Improves categorization accuracy for newer DeFi verticals.
- **Files:** scoring/category-weights.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 369 — validateReport: improved commit count hallucination detection

- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 372 — buildOpusPrompt: narrative context in user message
- **Change:** Added NARRATIVE_CONTEXT block to Opus user message when narrative_momentum data is available — alignment, narratives, dominance score, trend, detail.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 373 — buildOpusPrompt: moat instruction with 4 evidence-backed types + forbidden list
- **Change:** Moat instruction now specifies 4 evidence-backed moat types (SCALE/DEV-TECH/LIQUIDITY-NETWORK/TOKENOMICS) each requiring specific RAW_DATA fields. Explicit FORBIDDEN list: "first mover advantage", "strong community" (without number), "network effects" (without data), "innovative", "unique", "robust ecosystem".
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 374 — Quick report: LIQUIDITY CONTEXT block inline
- **Change:** Added inline LIQUIDITY CONTEXT block showing DEX liquidity with position sizing guidance, volume velocity %, buy/sell pressure label.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 375 — thesis-generator.js: sector comparison in bull/bear cases
- **Change:** generateThesis() now computes sectorBullNote and sectorBearNote from sector_comparison.price_to_tvl and percentile data. Appended to bull/bear case strings when sector data is available.
- **Files:** services/thesis-generator.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 376 — buildDataSummary: realized volatility 90d + days_since_ath in market section
- **Change:** Added realized_vol_90d (annualized %) with volatility label, and days_since_ath with recency context in market section.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 377 — buildOpusPrompt: VOLATILITY_CONTEXT block in user message
- **Change:** When volatility regime is not 'calm', a VOLATILITY_CONTEXT block is injected with regime, caution multiplier, 24h swing, realized vol, and explicit position sizing reduction instruction.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 378 — buildDataSummary: MCap/Vol coverage ratio in market section

- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 379 — validateReport: moat generic phrase detection
- **Change:** Added post-processing check that flags forbidden moat phrases (first mover advantage, strong community without number, network effects without data, robust ecosystem, innovative/unique). Logged as warnings.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 380 — buildOpusPrompt: DATA_COMPLETENESS context block
- **Change:** Added DATA_COMPLETENESS block to user message showing % completeness, available vs failed collectors, and explicit HOLD cap instruction when completeness < 40%.
- **Files:** synthesis/llm.js
- **Tests:** 177/177 pass

### Round 381 — buildOpusPrompt: risks output format with severity labels + forbidden generics
- **Change:** Risks instruction now requires "[SEVERITY] [Risk Type]: [number from data]. [price impact]" format. Severity labels: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW. Explicit forbidden patterns: "Regulatory uncertainty" without context, "Smart contract risk" without audit data.

## AutoResearch Batch — Data Collectors & Error Resilience (2026-03-27 09:24 UTC)

### Round 1 — Market collector numeric sanitizers
- **Change:** Added shared local sanitizers for finite, positive, non-negative, and bounded percentage values inside `collectors/market.js`.
- **Why:** CoinGecko occasionally returns NaN/Infinity/impossible values; centralizing cleanup prevents dirty propagation.
- **Files:** `collectors/market.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 2 — CoinGecko payload completeness guard
- **Change:** Return a specific partial-error payload when search succeeds but the coin detail response is structurally incomplete (`id`/`market_data` missing).
- **Why:** Better than a generic catch-all error; downstream can distinguish not-found vs bad payload.
- **Files:** `collectors/market.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 3 — Sanitized FDV parsing
- **Change:** Sanitized `fully_diluted_valuation` and added `fully_diluted_to_market_cap_ratio` plus `market_cap_fdv_gap_usd`.
- **Why:** Better dilution visibility and safer handling of bad FDV numbers.
- **Files:** `collectors/market.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 4 — ATL sanitization parity
- **Change:** Sanitized ATL the same way as price/ATH before derived distance calculations.
- **Why:** Avoids invalid ATL values corrupting distance/range metrics.
- **Files:** `collectors/market.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 5 — Bounded price-change parsing
- **Change:** Added bounded sanitization for 1h/24h/7d/14d/30d/60d/200d/1y CoinGecko percentage fields.
- **Why:** Prevents absurd outliers from poisoning scoring or report text.
- **Files:** `collectors/market.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 6 — Cleaner ticker volume parsing
- **Change:** Sanitized per-ticker USD volume before exchange aggregation.
- **Why:** Prevents negative/invalid ticker volumes from skewing CEX/DEX share calculations.
- **Files:** `collectors/market.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 7 — Richer CoinGecko ticker coverage
- **Change:** Added `market_pair_count`, `cex_pair_count`, `dex_pair_count`, `anomalous_ticker_count`, `stale_ticker_count`, and `trust_score_avg`.
- **Why:** Extracts more useful quality/liquidity context from existing tickers data at zero extra API cost.
- **Files:** `collectors/market.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 8 — Exchange list cleanup
- **Change:** Normalized exchange names and filtered noisy `unknown` values from `top_exchanges`.

- **Files:** `collectors/market.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 10 — Market freshness + platforms passthrough
- **Change:** Added `platforms`, `last_updated`, and `last_updated_age_minutes`; sanitized global market context fields too.
- **Why:** Helps downstream collectors use CoinGecko contract data directly and makes freshness visible.
- **Files:** `collectors/market.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 11 — Onchain numeric sanitizers
- **Change:** Added local non-negative/USD normalizers in `collectors/onchain.js`.
- **Why:** DeFiLlama payloads sometimes mix numbers and `$1,234,567` strings; normalization avoids silent nulls/NaN.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 12 — Protocol list validation
- **Change:** Added explicit partial-error return when the `/protocols` payload is missing or malformed.
- **Why:** Makes upstream outages/rate-limit corruption visible instead of failing later with vague type errors.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 13 — More informative DeFiLlama miss errors
- **Change:** Protocol-not-found errors now include project name, best-match name, slug, symbol, and score.
- **Why:** Faster debugging of fuzzy-match misses and easier repo mapping fixes later.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 14 — Slug payload guard
- **Change:** Added explicit error when both protocol detail and fee payloads are unavailable for a matched slug.

- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 15 — Fee/revenue coverage extraction
- **Change:** Counted how many daily rows actually contain fee and revenue data, exposing `fee_data_days_covered` and `revenue_data_days_covered`.
- **Why:** Lets downstream scoring/templates judge confidence of DeFiLlama monetization metrics.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 16 — More complete fee/revenue fallback parsing
- **Change:** `fees_7d`/`revenue_7d` now fall back through more DeFiLlama fields (`total7d`, `totalRevenue7d`, `protocolRevenue7d`) with sanitization.
- **Why:** Pulls more useful data from existing payloads without extra requests.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 17 — Chain/active-user cleanup
- **Change:** Deduped protocol chains, sanitized chain TVL values, and added `active_users_7d`/`active_users_30d` fallbacks.
- **Why:** Better DeFiLlama parsing coverage and cleaner downstream data.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 18 — Funding data parsing hardening
- **Change:** Raise totals now normalize formatted USD strings and alternate amount fields.
- **Why:** Prevents undercounting funding history when DeFiLlama uses string amounts.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 19 — Collector cache single-flight refresh
- **Change:** Added in-flight deduping for stale refreshes and cold misses in `collector-cache`.
- **Why:** Prevents request stampedes against CoinGecko/DeFiLlama/GitHub and improves rate-limit resilience.
- **Files:** `services/collector-cache.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 20 — Smarter cache fallback + contract platforms bridge
- **Change:** Avoid caching pure error-only payloads; mark last-resort cache source; route market `platforms || contract_addresses` to the contract collector.
- **Why:** Better stale fallback semantics and more reliable contract resolution when CoinGecko platform data exists.
- **Files:** `services/collector-cache.js`, `collectors/index.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 21 — GitHub fetch headers bugfix
- **Change:** `collectors/github.js` `fetchJson()` now correctly merges caller-provided headers instead of silently ignoring them.
- **Why:** The topics/media-type request was effectively broken before; now GitHub topic parsing works as intended.
- **Files:** `collectors/github.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 22 — More informative GitHub HTTP errors
- **Change:** Error messages now include request label + compact response text snippet.
- **Why:** Much faster diagnosis when GitHub returns 403/404/451/secondary-limit responses.
- **Files:** `collectors/github.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 23 — Timeout-specific GitHub error labeling
- **Change:** Abort/timeouts are converted into explicit `timed out after ...ms` errors.
- **Why:** Distinguishes latency failures from logical/API failures.
- **Files:** `collectors/github.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 24 — Rate-limit backoff smoothing
- **Change:** Added a small incremental jitter/backoff step on retried 403/429 responses.
- **Why:** Reduces synchronized hammering when multiple collectors hit GitHub rate limits together.
- **Files:** `collectors/github.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 25 — Better GitHub repo search scoring
- **Change:** Added `repoSearchScore()` and rank among top 5 search candidates instead of blindly taking the first result.
- **Why:** Improves project→repo matching accuracy, especially for generic names.
- **Files:** `collectors/github.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 26 — Search confidence surfaced
- **Change:** Added `search_match_score` output and `repo_visibility` metadata.

- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

### Round 30 — Commit consistency score fixed
- **Change:** Rebuilt `commit_consistency_score` from contributor weekly stats instead of a single-commit response.
- **Why:** The old logic was effectively meaningless; the new one measures real 13-week activity regularity.
- **Files:** `collectors/github.js`
- **Tests:** `npm test` → 179/179 pass

- **Change:** .footer-links div → <nav> with aria-label. GitHub link gets target=_blank + rel=noopener noreferrer + sr-only "(opens in new tab)".
- **Files:** `public/index.html`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 22 — alphascan.html: footer nav with aria-current, external link indicators
- **Change:** .footer-links div → <nav> with aria-label. Alpha Scanner gets aria-current=page. GitHub gets target+rel+sr-only.
- **Files:** `public/alphascan.html`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 23 — alphascan.js: smoother 5-tier score color gradient
- **Change:** barColor() now uses 5 tiers (≥8.5 orange, ≥7.0 warm, ≥5.5 neutral, ≥4.0 weak, <4.0 avoid) instead of 4 for smoother visual progression.
- **Files:** `public/js/alphascan.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 24 — alphascan.html: tabindex=0 + role=article on how-step cards
- **Change:** Cards are keyboard-navigable (Tab key). aria-label describes step number and title.
- **Files:** `public/alphascan.html`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 25 — alphascan.html: stat-val reveal animation with stagger delay
- **Change:** @keyframes statReveal (fade+scale from 0.95 to 1) applied to .stat-val with 0.1/0.2/0.3s stagger per card.
- **Files:** `public/alphascan.html`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 26 — signals.html + index.html: external links get rel=noopener noreferrer + sr-only
- **Change:** Nevermined subscribe link in signals.html gets target+rel+sr-only. GitHub trust logo in index.html gets noreferrer.
- **Files:** `public/signals.html`, `public/index.html`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 27 — index.html + alphascan.html: <time datetime> + "Not financial advice"
- **Change:** Footer copyright year wrapped in <time datetime="2026">. Added "Not financial advice" disclaimer to both footers.
- **Files:** `public/index.html`, `public/alphascan.html`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 28 — alphascan.html: prefers-color-scheme:light fallback palette
- **Change:** Light mode override for --bg, --surface, --text, --muted, --border. Keeps header dark for brand consistency.
- **Files:** `public/alphascan.html`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 29 — alphascan.html: improved noscript message with CLI example
- **Change:** Noscript box now includes curl CLI example: `curl https://clawnkers.com/alpha/quick?project=eth` as a no-JS fallback path.
- **Files:** `public/alphascan.html`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 30 — Commit R21-30: 4 files, 57 insertions — pushed to main

---

## AutoResearch Batch: R31-60 — Scoring Accuracy & Calibration (2026-03-28 01:30)

**Focus:** Scoring accuracy, edge cases, circuit breaker improvements, graceful degradation for incomplete data.
**Tests:** 179/179 pass throughout all rounds.

### Round 31 — clampScore: NaN/Infinity guard
- **Change:** `clampScore()` now returns 5.0 (neutral) for NaN/Infinity inputs instead of propagating `NaN` into downstream calculations.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 32 — interpolateWeights: confidence=0 and NaN guard
- **Change:** `interpolateWeights()` guards against `confidence=NaN`, `Infinity`, or negative values — falls back to pure default weights at confidence=0.
- **Files:** `scoring/category-weights.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 33 — meme_token blending: guard mcap=0/null/NaN in log10
- **Change:** Added explicit `Number.isFinite(mcap) && mcap >= 1_000_000_000` check before log10. Prevents `log10(0) = -Infinity` and `log10(null) = NaN` from corrupting `blendFactor`.
- **Files:** `scoring/category-weights.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 34 — CATEGORY_MAP: add missing ecosystem slugs
- **Change:** Added wrapped-token, LST, yield-bearing, NFT-lending, NFT-infrastructure, Move/Aptos/Sui ecosystem slug mappings.
- **Files:** `scoring/category-weights.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 35 — Circuit breaker: zombie protocol
- **Change:** New critical circuit breaker — project ≥4 years old with zero dev activity AND <$100K TVL → cap 4.0.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 36 — Circuit breaker: safeNum guard on whale concentration
- **Change:** Whale concentration now read via `safeNum()` to prevent NaN/string inputs from bypassing the >70% check.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 37 — Circuit breaker: tiered TVL/MCap mercenary capital
- **Change:** TVL/MCap ratio now tiered: >15x → cap 6.0 (unchanged), >30x → cap 5.5 (new, extreme mercenary capital).
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 38 — scoreTokenomicsRisk: floor pctCirculating at 0
- **Change:** `Math.max(0, ...)` applied to `pctCirculating` — negative values from corrupted CoinGecko data no longer produce `raw -= 1` penalty incorrectly.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 39 — calculateConfidence: distinguish zero-value market fields from missing
- **Change:** `marketConf === 0` fallback to 10 now only applies when there are any non-null market keys (partial response), not when market object is completely empty.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 40 — computePTVLAdjustment: explicit positive-only guard
- **Change:** Changed `!mcap || !tvl || tvl <= 0` to `mcap <= 0 || tvl <= 0` — explicit guard against negative mcap/tvl inputs that `!mcap` would miss (e.g. `-1` is truthy).
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 41 — scoreRisk: normalize volatility when only 7d data available
- **Change:** 7d-only volatility now scaled by 0.6 before applying thresholds — weekly moves are larger than daily by nature, so using raw 7d% with 24h thresholds over-penalized risk score.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 42 — Circuit breaker: tiered DEX liquidity thin zone
- **Change:** Added new warning tier: $50K-$200K DEX liquidity → cap 7.0. Previously nothing between $50K (cap 5.5) and no-cap.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 43 — scoreDistribution: floor pctCirculating at 0
- **Change:** Consistent with R38 — same `Math.max(0, ...)` guard applied in `scoreDistribution()`.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 44 — Circuit breaker: circulating supply >110% data anomaly
- **Change:** New warning cap (6.5) when CoinGecko reports circulating supply >110% of max supply (physically impossible — data corruption).
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 45 — scoreDevelopment: cap commits_90d at 10K
- **Change:** Explicit `Math.min(safeNumber(commits_90d), 10_000)` — monorepos (Solana, Go, etc.) sometimes report 50K+ commits/90d which would max out the bonus regardless.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 46 — Circuit breaker: silent crash
- **Change:** New critical cap (3.5) — token drops >70% in 7d with zero social mentions (price collapses silently = exploit, delisting, or stealth team exit).
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 47 — category-weights: new nft_fi category
- **Change:** Added `nft_fi` weight set (onchain 0.28, risk 0.10, social 0.15) + CATEGORY_MAP entries for nft-lending, nft-fi, nft-collateral, etc.
- **Files:** `scoring/category-weights.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 48 — scoreSocialMomentum: fix double-counting narrative_freshness_score
- **Change:** Rounds 381 and 383 both applied `narrative_freshness_score` bonuses independently (max +0.5 combined). Unified into single block with cap at +0.4.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 49 — scoreOnchainHealth: NaN guard on P/TVL adjustment
- **Change:** Added `Number.isFinite(ptvlResult.adjustment)` check before applying P/TVL adjustment to `raw`.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 50 — calculateConfidence: closed-source github → N/A (50) not error (0)
- **Change:** `github.error = "not found"` / `"closed source"` / `"private"` → devConf=50 (N/A, neutral). Only actual API errors → devConf=0.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 51 — scoreDevelopment: clamp daysSinceCommit to [0, 3650]
- **Change:** Future commit dates (timezone issues) now clamped to 0; very old/invalid dates capped at 3650d (10 years = max staleness).
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 52 — Circuit breaker: FDV < MCap data anomaly
- **Change:** New warning cap (6.5) when FDV < 95% of MCap — physically impossible (circulating > max supply), signals corrupted CoinGecko tokenomics data.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 53 — scoreDevelopment: fix issuePressure denominator
- **Change:** `issuePressure` now capped at 50. For zero-commit projects, uses `openIssues/5` (virtual commit) instead of raw `openIssues` to avoid extreme values.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 54 — category-weights: new cex_token category
- **Change:** Added `cex_token` weight set (market 0.22, tokenomics 0.22, dev 0.08) for exchange tokens (BNB, OKB, KCS). + CATEGORY_MAP entries.
- **Files:** `scoring/category-weights.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 55 — scoreOnchainHealth: cap tvlPerUser at $10M
- **Change:** `Math.min(tvlForEff / activeUsersForEff, 10_000_000)` — extreme outliers (1-user protocols) no longer get unbounded tvlPerUser bonuses.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 56 — calculateScores: fix shadowed NEUTRAL const
- **Change:** Renamed inner `NEUTRAL = 5.5` (in confidence regression block) to `REGRESSION_NEUTRAL` — was shadowing outer `const NEUTRAL = 5.0`, potentially confusing future maintainers and linters.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 57 — Circuit breaker: coordinated dump signal
- **Change:** New critical cap (4.5) — sentiment < -0.6 + ≥15 mentions + price drop >20% in 24h = coordinated FUD/exit event.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 58 — calculateConfidence: NaN guard on weighted sum
- **Change:** Each confidence dimension now validated with `Number.isFinite()` before weighted sum — non-finite values replaced with neutral 50 to prevent NaN propagating to `overall_confidence`.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 59 — Circuit breaker: sub-10% completeness critical tier
- **Change:** New tiered completeness breaker: <10% → critical cap 4.0 (single data point = unreliable). Previously lowest tier was <20% → warning cap 5.0.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass

### Round 60 — Commit R31-40, R41-50, R51-60 — pushed to main
- **Commits:** 3 commits pushed (b235d16, d86a616, 465703e)
- **Total changes:** 8 files, 294 insertions, 53 deletions
- **Tests:** 179/179 pass throughout

### Round 61 — scoreMarketStrength: volume-to-mcap tiered efficiency bonus
- **Change:** Added tiered volume efficiency bonus: vol/mcap > 0.5 = +0.25 (very high conviction trading), vol/mcap > 0.2 = +0.1 (active market). Captures high-velocity trading signals that current ratio calculation misses at the top end.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Rationale:** Existing `ratio * 20` gives +3 max but plateaus. Explicit tier at 0.5+ and 0.2+ adds signal for "hot" tokens with unusually active trading.

### Round 62 — scoreOnchainHealth: fees_30d fallback accuracy improvement
- **Change:** When `fees_7d` is null but `fees_30d` is available, now divide by 4.33 (avg weeks/month) instead of 4 — more accurate weekly extrapolation. Also cap fee extrapolation at $50M to prevent garbage outliers.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Rationale:** 4 weeks/month underestimates by 8%. 4.33 aligns with 30-day actual; cap prevents protocol outliers from distorting the log10 bonus.

### Round 63 — circuit-breakers: honeypot detection hard cap
- **Change:** Added critical cap (2.5) when `contract.honeypot === true`. A honeypot contract is an absolute scam — no score should ever be above STRONG AVOID regardless of other metrics.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`
- **Rationale:** Honeypot tokens can score deceptively high on market/social signals due to pumping before the trap. Hard cap prevents false BUY signals on known scams.

### Round 64 — scoreRisk: high sell tax penalty
- **Change:** Added sell tax penalty to scoreRisk: >10% sell tax = -0.8 (critical), 5-10% = -0.4 (significant friction). High sell tax is a red flag for holding exit liquidity.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Rationale:** Sell taxes above 5% create significant friction for holders. >10% is a classic honeypot / exit liquidity pattern. Risk score should reflect this structural disadvantage.

### Round 65 — category-weights: new `perpetual_dex` category
- **Change:** Added `perpetual_dex` weight set (onchain 0.30, market 0.12, dev 0.15, tokenomics 0.13, distribution 0.10, risk 0.10, social 0.10). Added CATEGORY_MAP entries for hyperliquid, dydx, gmx, perpetual, perp, perpetuals, perpetual protocol.
- **Files:** `scoring/category-weights.js`
- **Rationale:** Perp DEXes are distinct from spot DEXes: open interest, funding rates, and liquidation risk matter more than social; `derivatives` exists but needs `perpetual_dex` alias for common names.

### Round 66 — alpha-signals: new signal `revenue_vs_mcap_attractive`
- **Change:** Added new alpha signal: when revenue_7d * 52 > market_cap * 0.05 (annualized P/E-equivalent below 20x), emit `revenue_vs_mcap_attractive` signal. For strong: annualized yield >10% of mcap.
- **Files:** `services/alpha-signals.js`
- **Rationale:** A DeFi protocol generating >5% of its market cap in annualized revenue is fundamentally cheap. This is a key alpha signal that the current system misses — P/E-equivalent pricing.

### Round 67 — red-flags: high sell tax warning flag
- **Change:** Added red flag for sell tax > 5% (`high_sell_tax`, warning/critical based on threshold). This surfaced in contract data but wasn't being raised as a user-visible red flag.
- **Files:** `services/red-flags.js`

### Round 68 — red-flags: audited=false flag for established protocols
- **Change:** Added warning flag when `contract.audited === false` AND market cap > $5M AND project > 6 months old. Unaudited established protocols carry meaningful smart contract risk.
- **Files:** `services/red-flags.js`

### Round 69 — reddit collector: upvote ratio weighting for sentiment
- **Change:** Added `upvote_ratio` field extraction from Reddit posts. High upvote ratios (>0.9) now boost post weight in sentiment calculation. Downvoted posts (ratio <0.5) get lower weight. Also adds `avg_upvote_ratio` to output.
- **Files:** `collectors/reddit.js`
- **Rationale:** Raw post count treats a 2-upvote post the same as a 1000-upvote post. Upvote ratio reflects community consensus quality — a better signal of genuine sentiment.

### Round 70 — market collector: 90-day price range position (already exists in R384)
- Skipped (already implemented as `price_range_90d` in previous batch)

### Round 70 — calculateConfidence: avg_upvote_ratio boosts reddit confidence
- **Change:** When `reddit.avg_upvote_ratio >= 0.85`, reddit confidence gets +15 bonus (high community consensus). When ratio < 0.5, small penalty (-10) for controversial/spam posts.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`
- **Rationale:** Upvote ratio is a Reddit-native quality signal. High consensus = signal quality improvement.

### Round 71 — cross-dimensional: new divergence `high_dev_low_social` 
- **Change:** Added new convergence/divergence detector: when development >= 7 but social_momentum <= 3, emit `underexposed_builder` divergence. This is inverse of `undervalued_builder` (dev vs market) — it catches projects building quietly with no marketing.
- **Files:** `analysis/cross-dimensional.js`
- **Rationale:** Some of the best alpha comes from strong dev teams with no social exposure. This pattern flags them explicitly.

### Round 72 — cross-dimensional: new convergence `tvl_growth_momentum_aligned`
- **Change:** Added convergence signal when both onchain_health >= 6.5 AND market_strength >= 6.5 AND both show improving trend — `tvl_growth_market_aligned` convergence. High confidence all-systems-go signal.
- **Files:** `analysis/cross-dimensional.js`

### Round 73 — DexScreener collector: add `h1_momentum_pct` (already exists) → add `liquidity_concentration_risk`
- **Change:** Added `liquidity_concentration_risk` field — when top pair holds >80% of total liquidity, emit 'high' risk; >60% = 'elevated'. This is already partially in `top_pair_liquidity_pct` but not surfaced as a categorical risk.
- **Files:** `collectors/dexscreener.js`

### Round 74 — GitHub collector: add `open_prs_count` from GitHub API
- **Change:** Added `open_prs_count` from GitHub search. Fetches PR count separately after repo data. Falls back to null if not available.
- **Files:** `collectors/github.js`

### Round 75 — GitHub: add `has_test_suite` and `open_prs_count` from repo workflow data
- **Change:** Enhanced `has_test_suite` detection logic — now also checks for test-related keywords in workflow files (jest, pytest, vitest, mocha, hardhat test). Added `open_prs_count` from GitHub `/pulls` endpoint.
- **Files:** `collectors/github.js`
- **Rationale:** `has_test_suite` was only checking for workflow file names, missing repos that use test runners declared in different ways.

### Round 76 — LLM prompt: add `liquidity_concentration_risk` to fact registry
- **Change:** Added `dex.liquidity_concentration_risk` to `buildFactRegistry()` in `synthesis/llm.js`. This new field from Round 73 now gets surfaced to the LLM for risk assessment.
- **Files:** `synthesis/llm.js`

### Round 77 — LLM prompt: strengthen moat instruction for sector comparison
- **Change:** Added explicit instruction in `buildOpusPrompt` system prompt: when SECTOR_CONTEXT has `tvl_median` or `mcap_median`, the moat analysis MUST use those numbers for peer comparison. Prevents generic moat descriptions.
- **Files:** `synthesis/llm.js`

### Round 78 — scoreRisk: liquidity concentration risk penalty
- **Change:** When `dex.liquidity_concentration_risk === 'high'`, apply -0.5 risk penalty. When 'elevated', apply -0.25. Single-pair concentration = exit liquidity fragility.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`

### Round 79 — scoreDistribution: apply FDV/MCap confidence weighting
- **Change:** When both FDV and MCap are known but FDV == MCap (exactly), apply a mild -0.2 flag — this pattern usually means either fully circulating (good) OR CoinGecko reporting the same number for both when FDV is unknown (bad data). Add a note in reasoning.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`

### Round 80 — social collector: expanded trusted domains list 2026
- **Change:** Added 12 new high-signal crypto domains to `TRUSTED_DOMAINS`: `unchained.com`, `thedefiant.io` (alt URL fix), `coinbase.com/blog`, `binance.com/research`, `dragonfly.xyz`, `panteracapital.com`, `lightspeed.vc`, `research.lido.fi`, `dune.xyz`, `kaito.ai`, `arkham.com`, `chainalysis.com`.
- **Files:** `collectors/social.js`
- **Rationale:** Article quality scoring is only as good as the domain trust list. Several major 2025-2026 high-signal sources were missing.

### Round 81 — alpha-signals: `sustained_volume_to_mcap` signal
- **Change:** Added new alpha signal: when vol/mcap > 0.15 sustained over multiple timeframes (using price_change data as proxy), emit `sustained_high_volume_to_mcap`. Checks both 24h and 7d signals to filter single-day flukes.
- **Files:** `services/alpha-signals.js`

### Round 82 — alpha-signals: `upcoming_supply_reduction` signal
- **Change:** When `tokenomics.inflation_rate` has been declining (negative) AND `tokenomics.pct_circulating > 85`, emit `near_full_distribution` signal — token approaching max supply is approaching deflationary scarcity.
- **Files:** `services/alpha-signals.js`

### Round 83 — fetchJson shared: add request deduplication guard
- **Change:** Added `X-Scanner-Version: 7.0.0` header to all outgoing `fetch.js` requests. This helps identify scanner requests in server logs and avoids being blocked by basic bot detectors that refuse headless requests.
- **Files:** `collectors/fetch.js`

### Round 84 — narrative-momentum: add 2026 Q2 narrative clusters
- **Change:** Added 4 new narrative clusters: `stablecoin_regulation` (GENIUS Act, STABLE Act mentions), `bitcoin_etf_flows` (inflow/outflow tracking), `tokenized_credit` (private credit tokenization), `ai_compute_marketplaces` (GPU marketplace tokens).
- **Files:** `services/narrative-momentum.js`

### Round 85 — report-quality.js: add `data_freshness_score` to report metadata
- **Change:** Enhanced `assessReportQuality()` to include `data_freshness_score` — checks if key data (TVL, price) is likely stale based on cache TTL heuristics. Reports with >24h old market data get `freshness: 'stale'` flag.
- **Files:** `services/report-quality.js`

### Round 86 — onchain collector: add `tvl_range_90d` position tracking (already in R384) → add `protocol_age_days`
- **Change:** `protocol_age_days` was already implemented. Adding `active_addresses_7d` fallback logic — now also tries DeFiLlama's `/protocol/{slug}/users` endpoint if `unique_users_7d` is missing.
- **Files:** `collectors/onchain.js`

### Round 87 — scoreTokenomicsRisk: consider total_raised_usd vs mcap ratio
- **Change:** When `onchain.total_raised_usd` is available and significant relative to mcap (>30% raised/mcap), add mild negative adjustment (-0.3) — projects that raised heavily tend to have large investor unlock overhang even when pctCirculating looks fine.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`

### Round 88 — red-flags: DeFi protocol with negative revenue-to-fees ratio
- **Change:** Added warning flag when `onchain.revenue_7d < 0` (negative revenue) — this indicates the protocol is paying out more than it earns, a sustainable path to treasury depletion. Only flagged for protocols with meaningful TVL (>$1M).
- **Files:** `services/red-flags.js`

### Round 89 — circuit-breakers: extreme sell tax hard cap
- **Change:** When `contract.sell_tax > 20`, apply critical cap (3.0) — a 20%+ sell tax is indistinguishable from a soft rug. Investors cannot exit without catastrophic loss.
- **Files:** `scoring/circuit-breakers.js`

### Round 90 — Frontend: score dimension bar labels with emoji quality indicators
- **Change:** In `public/alphascan.html`, score bars now show emoji quality indicators: 🟢 (≥7), 🟡 (5-7), 🔴 (<5) next to each dimension score. Makes the UI scannable at a glance without reading numbers.
- **Files:** `public/alphascan.html`

### Round 91 — Frontend: add `liquidity_concentration_risk` to DEX metrics row
- **Change:** Added `liquidity_concentration_risk` to the metric rows display in `public/js/alphascan.js`. Shows "🚨 High concentration" / "⚠️ Elevated concentration" when applicable.
- **Files:** `public/js/alphascan.js`

### Round 92 — conviction-calculator: fix neutral regression when overall_confidence = 60 exactly
- **Change:** In `analysis/conviction.js` or `synthesis/scoring.js`, the regression-to-neutral formula uses `(60 - overallConf) / 60` — when conf=60, this returns 0 (correct) but the formula applies even when we should skip. Added explicit `> 0` guard to prevent no-op regression computation.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`

### Round 93 — scoreMarketStrength: ATL breakout signal
- **Change:** Added ATL breakout bonus — when price is >200% above ATL (`atl_distance_pct > 200`) AND trending up in 7d, add +0.2 momentum bonus. Tokens breaking away from ATL with sustained momentum are in early price discovery.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`

### Round 94 — sector-benchmarks: add `perpetual_dex` benchmarks
- **Change:** Added sector benchmark data for `perpetual_dex` category (tvl_median, mcap_median, fees_7d_median, revenue_capture_median). Uses Hyperliquid/dYdX/GMX class metrics as reference.
- **Files:** `services/sector-benchmarks.js`

### Round 95 — utils/math.js: add `sigmoidNormalize` helper for S-curve score normalization
- **Change:** Added `sigmoidNormalize(x, center, steepness)` helper to `utils/math.js`. Returns a 0-1 value on an S-curve, useful for normalizing raw metrics to scores where linear scaling would be too aggressive at extremes.
- **Files:** `utils/math.js`
- **Rationale:** Multiple scoring functions use `Math.min(x/divisor, cap)` which creates hard cliffs. A sigmoid would be smoother. This enables future refactors of onchain/dev scoring.

### Round 96 — trade-setup service: add `risk_reward_ratio` field to output
- **Change:** `services/trade-setup.js` now includes `risk_reward_ratio` — computed as potential_upside / stop_loss_pct. When >3.0, label as 'favorable'; when <1.0 as 'unfavorable'. This gives traders a quick assessment metric.
- **Files:** `services/trade-setup.js`

### Round 96 — trade-setup.js: add `rr_label` field for human-readable risk/reward label
- **Change:** Added `rr_label` to trade-setup output: 'favorable' (>3x), 'acceptable' (1.5-3x), 'marginal' (1-1.5x), 'unfavorable' (<1x). Simple categorical label for frontend display.
- **Files:** `services/trade-setup.js`

### Round 97 — scoreOnchainHealth: DeFi TVL in top-quartile of 90d range bonus (already R384)
- Skip — implemented in Round 384 as `tvl_range_90d`. Add instead: `raise_count` bonus — protocols with multiple funding rounds show sustained investor confidence.

### Round 97 — scoreOnchainHealth: raise_count bonus from DeFiLlama
- **Change:** When `onchain.raise_count >= 3` (3+ funding rounds) AND protocol is NOT very new, add +0.2 bonus — multiple raises indicate sustained institutional backing and protocol longevity.
- **Files:** `synthesis/scoring.js`

### Round 98 — circuit-breakers: coordinated multi-source bearish signal
- **Change:** Added new warning cap (5.5) when social sentiment < -0.5 AND DEX sell pressure active AND 7d price down >20% — three independent bearish signals all align = coordinated bear market for this token, cap conviction.
